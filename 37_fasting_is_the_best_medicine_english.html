<h1>1. The biggest mistake that we make
<a name="chapter01"></a></h1>
<div>
If thought wisely we are different.Our body is different.We are born and come to the earth wearing the body. If we are dying we are leaving the body and going.What is remarkable is that from birth to death we and our body live together as one.There is no life without the body. Birth and death is not in our hands, but the life between the two is in our hands. Such a life if lived healthy and comfortable or sick and suffering,we are responsible for it and it is not related to the body.If the body faces difficulties the mistake is ours. <b>The body is the vehicle we are traveling in so it has to run the way we ask it. Likewise,if we want to run it without any difficulty, we must also keep listening to it.Only then this journey of life will run peacefully till we reach the destination.</b> But the biggest mistake we all make is not listening to what the body says. We do not care about its needs. That is why we face difficulties with a variety of ailments. We rub our likes and dislikes on it but we don’t not listen to it’s concerns. Every living body is like an automatic machine.The body has the power to repair itself by birth. In order for that power to work, we must listen and act in accordance with what the body says. In this creation they are 84 lakhs of living creatures,to which doctor do they entrust their bodies to maintain health? What types of blood tests and X-rays are taken? What is their health secret? One hundred percent to get good health the one and only health secret they practice is.Listening to what the body says.
</div><div> 
Man has also practiced the same law for thousands of years and managed to survive without a doctor and disease.
</div><div>       
Inspite of having so many doctors and all sorts of medical procedures we fail to achieve full health? We seem to know to give the opportunity for a physician, but we are not knowing to give opportunity to the body before the doctor.Many people do not know that body has the ablity to reduce sickness by itself. Any vehicle made by us does cannot repair itself. It was made by man, so eventually man has to repair it. Then did we make our bodies? We did not make the body that is why its  wonderful mechanism is beyond our imagination and impossible from our intelligence. Automatically driven cars have not yet been invented by man, but the body we are traveling in is a car that runs automatically. In the same way it also has the power to repair itself automatically. It is enough if we don't squander that power, it will do its job. Unknowingly we are causing a lot of trouble to the body. We don’t drink water when it needs water. We drink when we like. We don’t feed it when it is hungry. Even if it says that it is time for it to rest and it cannot digest we do not listen and feed it late in the night. We stop the diposing of waste after eating.Whenever a disease substance enters our body,we do not listen to the suggestions that the body gives in the form of fever,mouth bitterness and immediately run to the doctor by not giving a chance for the body to repair itself.  The doctor gives some medicine. Because of which it stops doing its work.By taking these medications the power of the body's immune system reduces gradually.If we give chance to the body to reduce the disease our immunity will increase.We need to realize that our body is a great doctor. It is not wrong to take medication when our body cannot reduce it.Firstly we should adapt to live and change according to  the will of the body.
</div>
<h1>2. Who is the creator of fasting?
<a name="chapter02"></a></h1>
<div>
Both animals and human beings behave in the same way during the above situations.We all know that all kinds of body have the same law.Now let us think about the fourth topic. At times when the body doesn’t feel well or shows symptoms like stomach upset,fever or  lack of hunger it asks us to stop eating,roaming  and take rest for the day.Then we feel like listening to what the body says.Our wisdom and knowledge change our thoughts in sometime. Then we discuss our situation with our parents or elders at home.They suggest us to eat lunch  because if we delay we might feel giddy and later to visit the doctor. We tend to eat forcefully for reasons like food wastage and fatigue.We behave against the will of the body and submit ourselves to doctors.   Let us see what the 84 lakh animals do in this context.Because the body says it is not feeling well and asks us to stop eating and roaming from that moment animals stop eating completely.What need will have to roam if they cant eat. So they give rest to the body according to its will and sleep peacefully.They don’t have the need to discuss with parents or friends to stop eating and rest. They follow the law of the body and sleep.As the sloka says Dharmo  Rakshathi Rakshitha ,the same Dharma protects them.In this way they don’t eat and take rest and begin eating only if the body asks them to do so.In this manner from olden days till now they protect their health by fasting when the body asks. They do not have the need to teach this law to their children or grandchildren because from ages all animals have knowledge about this law by birth. This wisdom holds for both man and animals. Men also follow and respect this law without fail. A man’s work was only to name fasting but not to invent/create.Fasting was born even before man’s birth.This law is present on earth from the time this land had living creatures.Just as  water is used to quench thirst,food for hunger,rest for tiredness fasting for disease is also a same law. This fasting is not related to caste,religion,region,or environment.It is a fact related to all living creatures having a body.This not a myth. It is not created by our elders who are uneducated.This is the common law of the body by birth.The creator of our bodies has given us this gift of health. Just as animals respect it if we human beings also do then it’s a gift of health else it is a gift of disease. 
</div>
<h1>3. How can we reduce the sickness by keeping the stomach empty?
<a name="chapter03"></a></h1>
<div>
When our body has a problem, it tries to reduce by itself.This habit is congenital to the body. That's our luck. If the body does not do this, we all would have died long back.Actually we die not the body. The body needs extra energy to protect itself from the problem it is facing. Most of the energy in our body is spent to digest the food and to do work.Approximately 75% of our energy is spent each day by the body to do these two things. When the body is in trouble, it saves about 75% of the energy it spends in the day to protect itself from the problem, and plans how to protect itself.If man keeps eating and wandering all day,we will not be able to save energy in us so the body  the  plans to keep us away  from eating and roaming.It takes the first step to keep the stomach empty  by preventing  the mouth from sweetening and filling the tongue with bitter saliva,thereby removing the craving to eat . If we stay active we tend to roam and work so to stop us from roaming about it makes the body weak and suffer from body pains  so that we tend to sleep to feel better. So these  are the two ways that the body uses to save energy and use that energy to protect us.We will not feel the need to eat or roam until the work of the body to protect us is completed. It is the law of the body. Have you ever felt  symptoms like this from birth? No one can lie saying we never faced such symptoms.If we want we can still keep eating and roaming.Think once! To repair whom is the body is struggling so much.Are not its struggles to keep us comfortable. It is forcing  us to ask Bush from America to give us some energy? No it is not.It tells us that is has all the required amount of energy carry out the defense program and asks us not to waste that energy. That is a small request! Today you have eaten clean and rotated, yet never once did the sin of Thanksgiving.Yet I do not mind my duty. But today, if you ask me to give you a little rest, listen to me! The body is appealing to the occasion. If you do not mind every day, at least in the event of danger, our life will be more comfortable!No need for readings, intelligence, or medical science to make the body sound. These are the stumbling blocks for us to not hear the wall. Stomach can reduce the sickness? There are some doctors who are all superstitious and unscientific. When the field is dry, pests are reduced.The science of medicine and science was born before the birth of the real man to reduce the sickness of the stomach. Science of the same nature. No one is going to change this science. As long as there are creatures, this science is protecting them. And finally we have the same fate. The believer is as good as the animals. The unbeliever suffers like a man. The body will be able to save 75% 
</div><div>
<h1>4. Why is fasting called a greatest medicine?
<a name="chapter04"></a></h1>
<div>
of energy if we listen to our body and take rest once it shows symptoms like fever and cold.The energy saved in this manner will be later used by the body to fight against diseases.The body knows the area affected by the disease,the germs which caused the disease and the place where these germs hidden in the body.At times we fail to identify the reason for fever even after performing various blood tests.Though the test equipment may not be able to identify things but the body very well knows everything which is happening inside.The body itself carries out some action,reaction functions to destroy the microrganisms.Compared to normal situations whenever we fast the energy is saved,which is later not used to perform to other activities so the body sends its army of antibodies in a much powerful and active way to fight over the    body is capable to produce new antibodies by itself.Thes antibodies kill the bad bacteria and harmful germs but do not kill the good and useful bacteria. If we use antibiotic medicines they kill both bad and good bacteria along with some cells are helpful to keep the body healthy.For example, the weapons used during the recent war between America and Iraq killed both army and common man.But if we fast the energy present in our body is converted into immunity which releases antibodies and have a war  which is like a war of virtue.Just as Gandhiji has fought for freedom the body fights during fasting.The antibodies which are released during fasting stay in our body and are ever ready to kill the germs and micro organisms whenever they enter. The body  keeps a watch so that we don’t face same problem.Fasting increases immunity power. Everyone is aware that antibiotic medicines reduce immunity power.Whenever the body says that it is not able to produce antibodies which are needed to fight back the disease then we have no option than to use antibiotic medicines. We make a big mistake by not giving time to the body and start using medicine.The world says all medicines are drugs. Till date no medicine is said to be a good medicine. Fasting alone is said to be a  good medicine because every medicine is made from particles.   This medicine which the body prepares on its own is a medicine free from particles and drug free medicine.That is said to be the best medicine.There is no animal on earth which doesn’t fast. According to their situations they yes this natural antibiotic of fasting.From now onwards we all should start fasting as per our needs to live a safe life.
</div>
<h1>5. What is the duty of the body?
<a name="chapter05"></a></h1>
<div>
 We eat,wander,during the day, we sleep at night. The body also has day duty and night duty.
</div><div>
<b>Day Duty:-</b> Since we eat food during daytime, the first thing that the body does,is to digest the food we eat,turn that digested food into energy, give us that energy to work. If we look at the second thing,many cells in our body lose their life span and billions of cells die. Replacing new cells on everyday.
</div><div>
<b>Night Duty:- </b>The first duty is to purify the contaminants and metabolic emitted particles through the food we eat, water we drank and the air we inhaled during the day. If we look at the second duty, a few billion cells get sick every day. Repairing those sick cells and doing these two duties on a daily basis will not spoil the health. <b>The secret behind the disease not attacking animal body is that they eat and wander for 12 hours during the day. Once it gets dark,they rest (don’t eat and wander) and co operate with the body to perform night duty.</b> Nocturnal creatures rest for 12 hours during the day and support the duties of the body. This is not happening in our case. The body does not start the night duty, until daytime duty is completed. The women in our house  do not start cleaning until cooking is done. So is our body. Not just eating and roaming during the day, but eating and roaming at 10 and 11 o'clock at night. Moreover we don’t eat fruit or vegetable if its  late night .We boil, spice up, and turn it into pulao and eat. Because of which, it will be 4, 5 o'clock in the morning by the time the food gets digested. After that, the night duty of repair and cleaning will begin. Within 2 or 3 hours, we get up and start eating (day duty). Cleaning and repairing will stop. The contamination by the day food and poor performance of the night work makes the body a garbage dump.Our body becomes like a house which is not cleaned or repaired  filled with dust, dirt, mildew, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, and starts to stink. When the percentage of waste is increased, the body will protect itself from the rubbish,by making the mouth bitter so that we stop eating and no new waste enters the body.By starving for 1,2 days without eating anything and cleaning itself all the 24 hours in a day the body tries to make itself normal.If we do not stop eating those 1,2 days the body leaves it to our fate.The body says “ You are responsible for your own karma. Experience it.”
</div>
<h1>6. Fasting means?
<a name="chapter06"></a></h1>
<div>
When the body gets infected with seasonal diseases (fever, cough, wheezing, indigestion) and we keep the stomach empty , it is called fasting. So how many days we keep the stomach empty all the days are known as fasting.Fasting means when the body is functioning well,and before the waste causes disease we should  awaken and deliberately stop eating and cooperate with the body . Fasting is the process of digestion without eating day and night. Generally we eat during the day and stop eating  at night, then the body will be cleaning and repairing for 12 hours at night. We do not  eat for 12 hours during the day while fasting. So, now the body prepares to clean and repair during the day also. <b>Fasting means cleaning and repairing the body for 24 hours a day. </b>We wipe the house every day for half an hour or an hour. Although it is wiped on a regular basis it still has some dirt and, mildew so we completely wash it during festivals. The houses are being cleaned in the name of festivals. The body doesn’t even have the luck like the house. There is no regular cleaning (12 hours per night), not even during festivals. Moreover in the name of festivals more waste is put in the body. After the festival, when everyone leaves, the house is completely cleaned again,but even after the festival, the stomach is not cleaned and moreover the remaining things are put in the mouth. Man has taken this body for granted.Because we work for six days a week on the seventh day the Sunday we take rest.In the same way it is good if we give a day rest to the stomach also,fasting is kept  just as we settle the house during the lamp light and we fast before the arrival of the sickness.But we do not listen if we are asked to fast for good health that is the reason our elders wisely thought and kept that we if we fast we will be blessed. They think that man will surrender for God and blessings.Fasting  on Saturday, every Ekadasi, Pukotti Ekadasi, Shivaratri, Kartika Dharmasanam,weddings, in Yagnas  have two benefits. Fasting means approaching the Lord. Trying to get close to him. If the food is in the stomach,we don’t think about God. Moreover we tend to sleep. So, fasting has been linked in two ways both to spirituality and health. If we fast only for health it has more benefits to the body. However because our body also needs rest whether we have an opportunity or  we make an opportunity atleast once a week or once in a blue moon it is good to declare holiday for the stomach.
</div>
<h1>7. What to take in fasting?
<a name="chapter07"></a></h1>
<div>
Fasting means,giving holiday to the intestine ,conserving all the energy it spends on digestion every day and donating that energy to the body.In the same manner if we stop roaming (as much as possible), it would save all the energy spent on the work and also donate that energy to the body. During fasting, the body uses the energy saved by these two forms to remove and repair the accumulated trash and bugs. Without knowing what it means to fast,some bring a bad name to fasting. They do not get any benefits. Some people say they are fasting by not eating anything the whole day but eating a full meal (including three meals) at night. Others drink coffee and tea and be careful about not  to eat and think it is fasting.Some do eating only tiffins while others do eating fruit and drinking juices.Some others  eat little on Saturday mornings and do not eat anything in the evening and call is fasting.Some stop eating a single meal and say it is fasting.It is like something is better than nothing.Rather than eating two meals,eating single meal a day is much better.But fasting does not mean eating single meal. The reason for me to write about this so much is  that everyone is doing this and say did not benefit. <b>Any food that goes in during  fasting should be digested. To digest energy is needed.The energy which should be used for cleaning and repairing if used to work near the stomach only then how will fasting work.</b> Then if we don’t eat anything don’t we feel fatigue?Since man cannot rest fully like an animal, something is needed for it.Whatever we drink for energy,we should make sure that does not give work to the digestive system.Honey is the only food that goes into the blood directly without any work for the digestive system. Honey takes 10 and 15 minutes to get mixed with the blood and can instantly produce energy. Honey may be used in fasting to avoid fatigue. You can use up to 150-200 grams of honey in a day's fast. During fasting if we want the cleaning and repairing to take place properly,to remove all the waste properly,the body needs water.Therefore it is better to drink water during fasting. Fasting without drinking water does not bring health. On the day of fasting,if the body is rested well in the presence of honey and fresh water the repairing and cleaning process takes place well. Moreover we don’t feel fatigue. We feel more energetic.
</div>
<h1>8. How to fast?
<a name="chapter08"></a></h1>
<div>
Drink water as soon as you get up and try to pass motion smoothly. Relax without doing any exercises on the day of fasting. Drink water a second time and try to pass motion  second  time.It is good if the intestines are completely empty. It is better to have anemia if your bowel movement is not smooth. Those who are comfortable with diarrhea do not need anemia. Give  an  hour or half hour break and  drink a litre of water if possible. Likewise,you can stay by drinking water till 8am or 9am in the morning on the day of fasting. If you feel weak or you are aged it is enough if we drink water twice.Start drinking honey water at 9am or 10am. <b>In a large glass of water mix 4 teaspoons of honey + one lemon’s juice and drink.The sourness in the lemon juice can stop food cravings.Because of the high levels of Vitamin "C", immunity will increase and cleaning process also takes place well. </b>Drink 1 and 2 glasses of water after  half an hour. After an hour, again honey + lemon juice + 1 glass of water. Water again after half an hour, then honey water again after an hour. In this way we should keep drinking water,honey water till night.Drinking water can be stopped at 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening. Urination at night will happen without difficulty. Drink honey water for every 2 1/2 hours until you sleep. If hungry, you can still drink honey water beforehand or for 7,8 servings.It doesn’t matter if quarter package of honey is over on that day. Honey lemons should be mixed from time to time.It will get spoiled of mixed and kept in bottle. Take a bottle of honey, water and lemons if you are going out while you are fasting. If you do not have the opportunity to mix water and honey, you can take the honey in your hand lick it and drink water after it . Those who have the chance massage the skin and have steam inhalation during fasting. Or you can even get it done outside. Doing so will also cleanse the skin during fasting. During fasting,cold water shower should be taken including hair. Males can have bath twice if possible. During fasting period if you feel weak by evening and cant withstand even after drinking honey water then you can drink coconut water. It is better to rest on a fasting day.<b>Some people during fasting start eating snacks. If you eat it in between, cleaning process will stop and all your energy will be used for digesting food. The benefit is gone.</b> If cleaning takes place continuously only then we can be benefited!So do not touch anything. Even Prasadam also. If possible it is good to read good books, meditate heavily, or have spiritual thoughts, during fasting. Try to sleep early.
</div>
<h1>9. Who should fast and when?
<a name="chapter09"></a></h1>
<div>
Our body will also be clean just like a scooter which is clean after servicing, if we are fast once in a while. Fasting for long many days (long fast) means just the way cleaning of the scooter body also gets cleaned.We can also do scooter servicing by ourself. You need a good mechanic to get repaired. It also needs a good shed. In the same way,our body’s experience is not enough to do intense fasting. People who have good medical knowledge about it are needed. Natural homes are good in every way.<b>Please do not practice long fasting at home thinking it is good by doing it for a single day and continue it for 2,3 days. Many problems will come up. You can try to do it in your house for 1, 2 days.</b> Let us know who and for how many days they can do it.
</div><div>
<b>People who can do it for one day in a week:-</b> People who are very fat, employees who work in the shade, businessmen,people who smell a lot, people who eat at 10 and 11 o'clock at night, who eat a lot of flavors,non veg eaters etc can do it for one day in a week .My suggestion is Sunday is a good day to do fasting. Fasting on that day yields twice as much benefits.Usually Sundays means all kinds of waste is put in the body so atleast by this reason wastage,money,work for women all will be reduced. The body can also relax. Fasting on Sundays does not mean that you have to stay awake until Saturday night  12 o'clock and eat everything that should be eaten on Sunday and then sleep such things should not be done. Eat  fruits every Saturday by 5 or 6 clock. That is only dinner. Don't eat past that time. The food gets digested by 7 or 8 clock. From Saturday 8clock onwards the cleaning process inside the body begins. This only is a huge gain. If we finish our fasting by Sunday we can start our eating habits(juice,sprouts) normally from Monday morning. People who are fat(above mentioned people)will be highly benefited if they can stay on Mondays by consuming only fruits,fruit juices.Try your best based on your opportunity.
</div><div>
<b>Those who have to do once every 15 days:-</b> Hardworking, dull, thin, children, 60, 70 years old, etc., they can fast for once in every 15 days or two days a month.
</div><div>
<b>People who eat tasty foods for festivals and weddings:-</b>  Sankranti festival is known as big festival. The big festival means eating for many days.After the festival, each one starts  growling. <b>Eating all the varieties for 5 or 6 days during festivals,to avoid the body fall sick after it,to clean all the waste caused by eating different tastes we should fast based on the need for 1 day or 2 days by drinking honey water.</b> Fasting for 2 days means eating fruits or fruit juices on the third day and then on the fourth day you can get into a normal eating process. After the festival, just like the houses are cleaned and the body will also be completely cleaned and we will not fall sick. During marriages,if we eat full during the night the next day morning we should avoid having juices,tiffins till afternoon so that we can lunch easily. If anyone,anytime does not feel hungry,or feel indigestible,or cannot eat, or do not enjoy taste of the food, take the day off immediately on that day (stomach).
</div><div>
<b>Those who should not fast:-</b> Sick people,people habituated to tea,coffee(Until they stop having it and until they do not have headache) people who take 3,4 medicines for pains,people who take different types of medicines,people who feel fatigued,people with high blood levels,lactation mothers,people who feel giddy etc should not fast. Those who wander, etc., do not fast. Firstly,follow  the diet rules, if you improve your health then you can try if needed.
</div>
<h1>10. What should we do if we get fever?
<a name="chapter10"></a></h1>
<div>
The clouds come before it rains. Whenever it is cloudy we make sure we protect our things which are outside by getting them inside so that they don’t get drenched,but we are unable to know the symptoms before the onset of fever and we are fail to protect our body from becoming weak.Symptoms of fever before its onset can be excessive saliva on the tongue,which becomes white, with a slight odor of saliva, bitterness,the desire to not to eat food even if its time to eat,if we eat the food remains tasteless etc. If you notice some of these symptoms, stop eating from that moment and fast with honey and water. Within 1 or 2 days, the body cleanses without becoming feverish, and all the above symptoms are gone. When we get fever normally, stop eating food from that day and start fasting . When we have fever, we can drink  water mixed with honey and lemon juice they avoid fatigue for every 2 to 3 hours,in between we can keep drinking water. If the body is too hot, wash it all with a washcloth. If you are having body aches, bathe with hot water. <b>Don't particularly wish to reduce the heat.Wish to reduce the problem which is inside. Taking pills will reduce the heat before. Fasting leaves the heat and cleanses the fever from roots. As the fever subsides, the heat will decrease gradually.</b> The symptoms we should notice are that the tongue should decrease in bitterness, taste in the mouth, and fullness of appetite in the stomach. If fever does not subside, the second day also fasting should be done in the same way. You can drink coconut water if you fee fatigue. Honey water is better. Seek the doctor's advice when fever is very cold, extreme pains, pain in the joints or muscles. Use medication if necessary. Don't say I will not take drugs. There is nothing wrong with using drugs when needed. If the heat is completely reduced and the difficulty is reduced, you may  have coconut water and fruit juices for a whole day without eating the food immediately. Normal fevers surrender completely within 3 to 4 days during fasting. If the fever does not subside over the course of 3 or 4 days, it is better to go for a blood test on the advice of a doctor. If it is Typhoid, malaria fever,we should fast only  under the supervision of the doctor. It is advisable to use medication because it is not possible for you.
</div>
<h1>11. How to reduce cold?
<a name="chapter11"></a></h1>
<div>
It usually takes 10 to 15 days for the congestion to fully subside if it occurs once. Those who use drugs to reduce congestion will soon get infection which will cause congestion. Congestion should be reduced naturally. Some people have congestion 10 to 15 times a year. Others have during winters and monsoons. Others have running nose all the year. We also have the proverb saying that congestion can be reduced using a drug in a week, and can be reduced in seven days without using a drug. If the nose congestion is not reduced, some people undergo operation and clean the congestion. No matter how many times you do this,money is gone but not congestions. Let us know which rules need to be followed to reduce congestion.Water is the best medicine of all. But no one drinks water.People drink less water than usual thinking it will increase running nose.Drinking water quickly reduces infection. <b>Before we get congestion we have soreness feeling in the nose and throat.From that moment we should stop eating and start drinking warm water for 2 to 3 times in an hour Since this seems to be the case, drink 2 or 3 glasses and let the stomach be empty without eating anything.</b> If you feel dizzy, you can drink honey water.If we stay like this for a day without having any congestion the infection present inside will reduce .
</div><div>
<b>Things to do to reduce congestion quickly and naturally.</b>
<ol>
<li>Drink 5 liters of warm water throughout the day. </li>
<li>When the nose is tight and the air does not pass take honey in the little finger and apply it in the nostrils of the nose,this will thin the congestion and let the air pass. </li>
<li>It is advisable to apply a little coconut oil to your face and take steam inhalation during the morning hours or in the evening. The vapour makes the congestion reduce quickly.</li>

<h1>12. How to reduce cough
<a name="chapter12"></a></h1>
<div>
Whoever eats sweets, cool drinks, ice creams, artificially prepared foods and sustained foods often have a cough. Cough is natural for those who smoke cigarettes. When we eat the above foods for taste, bad bacteria, chemicals and toxins enter the lungs through the throat. The lungs absorb some of the mucus to send out those bad substances, causing it to travel through the throat in the form of a sputum. <b>To get rid of the sputum quickly, we have to stop taking cough medicine to reduce cough. This is because the body tends to release sputum in the form of cough.</b> 
</div><div>
<b>To reduce cough quickly</b> 
<ol>
<li>1.	Make sure the five litres of water which we drink daily is warm. </li>
<li>2.	In the morning we should put the neem stick in the water, chew it and spit the bitternesss along with the phlegm.</li> 
<li>3.	After cleaning the tongue we should remove phlegm by placing fingers on the tongue. </li>
<li>4.	Hot water bath should be done in two times in a day. </li>
<li>5.	We can apply coconut oil to the chest and when it pains, hot water foamentation can be put. The phlegm reduces easily buy hot foamentation. </li>
</ol>
</div><div>
Until the phlegm,cough reduce we should stop consuming juices,sprouts and remain fasting till afternoon by having honey water and eat only in the afternoon. By 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, eat fruits. If you eat late then we keep coughing all night during sleep.Fasting for one or two days throughout the day is recommended, if the cough is severe or the sputum is not immediately relieved.The more we keep eating unwanted things the more we suffer coughing. So it is better if you are careful from the beginning.

<h1>13. How am I doing fasting?
<a name="chapter13"></a></h1>
<div>
 From childhood onwards  we get fever quiet often. Whenever it comes even if we uses medicines we keep getting it often.After knowing about fasting in 1985,from then I started fasting whenever I have fever.Fever  reduced in a short time than  before, without the cost of a penny. Once I started eating better, fevers don't come even once a year also. I have been fasting every Saturday for five years since 1992. Since 1994, I have eaten 25% of salt and oil free food and 75% of uncooked food daily. Since 1997 I have stopped after sunset. Because of that,during the night body cleans itself on daily basis. So I stopped fasting one day a week. The body does not have to work on a regular basis, as I eat only fruits in the evening.
</div><div>
 In 1998, I ate even though I had the fever symptoms. Then the fever subsided after 2 days of fasting. In 2001 I started fasting when I had fever symptoms and the body healed without turning into a fever. Since about 10 years I haven’t used even a single medicine. If for a person like me who has so many problems and difficulties in life from childhood,the immunity power has increase so much I wonder how much it would increase for others. It recognises the upcoming problem before ten years and if we keep fasting you will not have the need to lie down in bed even for a day. Even if we work for 20 hours a day,even if air changes,even if the city changes,the body is prevents itself  from cough,cold, fever, etc. We have to change the  body anyways  is ready to change and function better. We are only late.

<h1>14. Benefits of fasting
<a name="chapter14"></a></h1>
<div>
I have been fasting from past 10 years and have been making thousands people to fast and their result of fasting is shcoking. They are not knowing the value of such great virtue,moreover they are scared. In 1998, I wrote a 420-page book, "Fasting Dharma," in order to overcome that fear and educate everyone to practice fasting. When you know all of those things, we feel excited to boost our body. In Hyderabad, a large central government agency (CCMB) has conducted experiments on fasting cells and published the results of their fasting that if we fast life span increases, and fasting controls the birth and death of cells which in turn makes fasting work very well for cancer patients.These days people only tend to believe things said by scientists only. First we need to listen to what our body says.If we listen to what our body tells our body is awaiting to give us increment and bonus.

<h1>15. Shall we listen to the body?

In order to move forward in spirituality, one must seek and find a teacher.To move forward in matters of health,we are already provided with a teacher without any need for search. That is your body. Even if searched for you cannot find a better teacher or a physician than the body. <b>If you think of the body as a guru and take every indication that it offers, as a health principle, and go ahead then your health will be following you. </b> All these days we have behaved without listening to the body.From onwards  whenever the body wishes we should behave and change accordingly and reform ourselves and protect our body.  Then health will sit within you. You don’t  have to run for health but the diseases will run away. Then we can enjoy a happy life with this body. Let us practice for such a life.
