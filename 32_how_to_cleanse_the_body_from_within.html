<h1>1. Where Exactly Should Cleansing Begin?
<a name="chapter01"></a></h1>
<div>
In the continuous metabolic processes of our body, many waste substances are constantly produced. Every single day, the body tries to expel these wastes. As long as these impurities are removed regularly and do not accumulate, the body experiences no difficulty.
</div><div>
But ever since “civilization” has advanced, people have mastered the art of eating — but not the art of eliminating. As a result, waste accumulates inside the body, and foul odors begin to emerge. To protect themselves from these smells, people use toothpaste, soaps, powders, phenyls, deodorants, and various fragrances — never stopping to ask why the body produces such odors in the first place.
</div><div>
When waste is released from our body, bathrooms and toilets give off strong smells. People pour phenyl, scrub them thoroughly, and ensure the bathroom is clean. If they themselves do not have time, they ask the women of the house or domestic help to clean it — never leaving it unattended. Such great care is taken for the cleanliness of the home.
</div><div>
But the house in which you live — the body — is it ever cleaned with the same attention? Have you ever thought about cleansing it from the inside with equal care?
</div><div>
If this thought has not occurred to you until now, understand how big a mistake it is.
</div><div>
At least from now on, give your own body the same care you give your home. Let us understand why health does not stay with us.
</div><div>
Since you want to cleanse your body internally, we must ask:
</div><div>
With what should the body be cleansed?
</div><div>
When should cleansing be done?
</div><div>
What should people do if they are not eliminating properly?
</div><div>
If we do not want waste to accumulate in the future, how should we live?
</div><div>
Let us learn all of this now and fix an auspicious beginning — a muhuratam — to start cleansing the body from within.
</div>

<h1>2. What Are the Impurities Produced Inside Our Body?
<a name="chapter02"></a></h1>
<div>
Our body is a vast community of billions of living cells. Millions of these cells together form an organ. Several organs together make this body. For such a body to stay alive, the cells within must constantly perform metabolic activity—the essential life process.
</div><div>
To sustain this life process, the cells need three vital elements:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Air</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Food</li>
</ul>
<div>
Nature provides these three essentials to us in gaseous, liquid, and solid forms. When we supply air, water and food, the cells take them in, perform their metabolic activities, and produce energy (heat). As long as the cells are capable of producing energy, we remain alive.
</div><div>
But whenever a substance is burnt or metabolized to produce energy, waste products are inevitably created. Just as burning wood in a stove produces heat, along with ash, charcoal and smoke, our cells too generate various wastes.
</div><div>
These wastes include:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Carbon dioxide (exhaled air)</li>
<li>Sweat</li>
<li>Urine</li>
<li>Stool</li>
</ul>
<div>
Every day, millions of cells also complete their lifespan and die. A dead cell is like a tiny corpse inside the body. These dead cells are also a form of waste — another kind of internal pollution. The body constantly tries, day after day, to expel all these wastes.
</div><div>
The question is:
</div><div>
Are we allowing the body to release these wastes?<br>
Or are we holding them inside?
</div><div>
Let us find out.
</div>
<h1>3. Reasons Why Impurities Accumulate in the Body
<a name="chapter03"></a></h1>
<div>
Every person fixes specific times for tea, tiffin, meals, and snacks. But no one fixes a time for the body’s essential needs — no “bowel time”, no “urination time”. This is one of the biggest reasons impurities accumulate inside the body.
</div><div>
Each day, people spend two to three hours eating and drinking. If even a fraction of that time were dedicated to properly eliminating wastes, impurities would never accumulate.
</div><div>
Human intelligence is the root of the problem. Animals do not have this issue, because they do not hold in anything — they release waste whenever the body demands it.
</div><div>
People reduce their water intake because they fear urinating frequently or making extra trips to the bathroom. As a result, the toxins that should be flushed out through urine remain inside and slowly accumulate.
</div><div>
We eat three or four times a day. But the waste produced from this food is not eliminated smoothly even once a day. Every day, 25% of dead cells must exit the body through stool. But because many people do not go for regular bowel movement — or go only once in two or three days — this waste collects inside the system.
</div><div>
When sweat begins to appear, people sprinkle powder, feel embarrassed about sweat marks, or dislike the smell — so they prevent sweating by using fans, air coolers, and air conditioners. Because we do little physical work that requires moving our arms or legs, sweat has almost no opportunity to form. Thus, the waste that should exit through the pores remains trapped under the skin.
</div><div>
Those who do physical work — who move their limbs — draw deep breaths, allowing more air into the lungs. That same deep breath brings more carbon dioxide out on the way back. But today, most work involves only the movement of fingers — typing, swiping, clicking. So the stale air inside the body remains, and carbon dioxide accumulates.
</div><div>
Across the four major channels of elimination — <b>stool, urine, sweat and breath</b> — the body produces waste every day. Yet we release only a small fraction, allowing three-fourths of the waste to remain inside.
</div><div>
We do not realize how harmful this accumulation can be. Let us now understand the damage that occurs when waste builds up inside the body.
</div>

<h1>4. The Damage Caused by Internal Pollution
<a name="chapter04"></a></h1>
<div>
Just as a speck in the eye or a fiber stuck between the teeth makes us restless until they are removed, the body too has no peace until it expels the impurities accumulating within it. The body constantly struggles to throw out these four types of wastes through the four channels of elimination — the body’s natural drainage system.
</div><div>
These impurities rise up to the “gate”, ready to leave. But when we do not give the body a chance to release them, it has no choice but to send them back inside.
</div><div>
After trying for many days and failing, the body finally gives up and decides: “Since I cannot expel this waste, let me store it somewhere — anywhere it faces no obstruction.”
</div><div>
If you ask where water collects in a field, everyone will say: “Wherever there is a low-lying area.”
</div><div>
Similarly, in the body, wherever there is weakness, or wherever there is less movement, that becomes the dumping place for accumulated toxins.
</div><div>
This is why, even though people in a family may eat the same food, not everyone develops the same diseases. The waste chooses its own “low spot” in each person’s body.
</div><div>
Now let us understand how these impurities eventually turn into disease-causing substances.
</div><div>
If you leave clean water undisturbed in a container for ten days, germs begin to grow. If you leave leftover rice or curry overnight, you can see microorganisms forming with your own eyes.
</div><div>
When good things spoil simply by being left undisturbed, what will happen to waste, which the body itself wants to throw out, but we keep stored inside?
</div><div>
These wastes naturally transform into disease-producing matter.
</div><div>
If clean water left stagnant becomes muddy water, and muddy water turns into a breeding ground for insects, then the stored waste inside us also becomes a breeding ground for disease-causing germs.
</div><div>
These germs, once formed, travel to various organs or body parts. Wherever they settle, that area becomes diseased. In medical terms, this is called infection.
</div><div>
Depending on where these disease-causing germs accumulate, the disease is named:
</div><div>
In the joints → Arthritis<br>
In the airways → Bronchitis<br>
Around the nose and sinuses → Sinusitis
</div><div>
The underlying cause is the same, but the name changes according to the affected area.
</div><div>
It is like gold:<br>
Melt it and shape it into a bangle for the wrist, it is called a bangle;<br>
Shape it into a chain for the neck, it is a necklace;<br>
For the waist, it becomes a waist belt.<br>
Though the material is gold in every case, the name changes with the place.
</div><div>
Similarly, diseases appear with different names, but their root cause is the same — disease-producing matter, which is born from retained waste.
</div><div>
And the source of this waste? The food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe — all going in, but not coming out properly.
</div><div>
Few understand that these become the foundation stones of disease.
</div><div>
Just as a person pokes his own eye with his own finger, we too damage our body with our own habits. What we create, we alone must suffer. Therefore, what we spoil, we must also correct. We must lay our own path back to health.
</div><div>
Doctors are not responsible for the waste accumulating in our body. Medical systems are not responsible. Environmental pollution is not responsible. Fertilizers and pesticides are not responsible. Parents or age are not responsible.
</div><div>
You alone are responsible for the waste that accumulates inside you.
</div><div>
Recognize this truth, and cooperate with your body by allowing it to release what it wants to release.
</div>
<h1>5. How Do Impurities Travel Inside the Body?
<a name="chapter05"></a></h1>
<div>
As metabolic activities take place within our body’s cells, waste substances are continuously produced. These impurities dissolve easily in water. From there, the body directs them toward the four organs of elimination for proper expulsion.
</div><div>
Those who drink sufficient water at the right times allow their impurities to dissolve and flow out smoothly on the same day they are generated. But for those who think:
</div><div>
“What’s the use of drinking water?”<br>
“Plain water has no taste.”
</div><div>
How will their impurities ever leave? Such waste simply accumulates inside the cells.
</div><div>
People insist on large amounts of water for washing the house, filling buckets for bathing, cleaning clothes, and so on. But when it comes to washing the inside of the body, cleansing millions of living cells, they try to manage with very little water.
</div><div>
They spend plenty of water cleaning the stool and urine that come out of the body — but they do not understand that the cells which produced that waste, and the pathways through which the waste travels, also need water to stay clean.
</div><div>
Some people cannot drink plain water and instead substitute coconut water, buttermilk, cool drinks, or barley water. They mistakenly believe these beverages cleanse the body internally.
</div><div>
But think about this: The glass in which you pour these drinks still needs to be washed at the end with plain water. If those liquids could really clean, why would we need water to wash the glass?
</div><div>
The same applies inside the body. To clean anything — whether inside or outside — water has no equal. Water is the very foundation of life. So let us learn the essential facts.
</div>
<ul>
<li>How much water should you drink each day for impurity removal?</li>
<li>At what times does water help cleanse the body most effectively?</li>
<li>When should you not drink water?</li>
<li>What type of water is best for internal cleansing?</li>
</ul>
<div>
Let us understand these important principles before moving forward.
</div>
<h1>6. How Important Is Water in the Body?
<a name="chapter06"></a></h1>
<div>
For the body to live, it depends on three essentials:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Air</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Food</li>
</ul>
<div>
If air does not reach us, we die within seconds. That is why it is the first essential.<br>
If water does not reach us, we may live only a few days. Therefore water is the second essential.<br>
If food does not reach us, we may still survive for months. Hence food is the third essential.
</div><div>
Once we understand this simple truth and nourish the body in the right order, why should health ever fail? If our health is damaged, it means we are making a mistake — often unknowingly. Though the mistake looks small to us, for the body it is a serious error.
</div><div>
In the first essential — air — people rarely go wrong. All the mistakes happen with the second and third essentials.
</div><div>
About 70% of the human body is water. The remaining 30% is matter — muscles, nerves, bones, and other tissues.
</div><div>
Just as Nature is three-fourths water and one-fourth land, the same proportion exists within us. By that logic, we should give the body three parts water and one part food each day.
</div><div>
But we have reversed this order. Most of us consume 70% food and only 30% water. Is that not true? Think about your daily life: Does more food go into your body, or more water? Everyone knows the answer.
</div><div>
Why do we reverse these basic necessities? There is only one reason:
</div><div>
When we eat, we enjoy taste — but when we drink plain water, what do we get in return, except urine?
</div><div>
Because taste tempts us, we push water — the body’s second essential — into third place, and elevate food into second place.
</div><div>
If we disrupt the body's priorities like this, how can health remain?
</div><div>
We forget that water brings health, not food; yet we keep eating more and more, thinking that’s where health lies.
</div><div>
In every household, mothers and wives encourage more food:
</div>
<ul>
<li>“Have one more idli — you’ll get strength.”</li>
<li>“Don’t drink so much water — drink this milk instead.”</li>
<li>“What should I cook tomorrow?”</li>
</ul>
<div>
Food receives great attention, while water is neglected. If we truly recognized water as the body’s second essential, our conversations at home would sound different:
</div>
<ul>
<li>“Please drink this little water.”</li>
<li>“Shall I pour you another glass?”</li>
<li>“How much water have you had today?”</li>
</ul>
<div>
Such words ought to be heard in every home.
</div><div>
Food is important for survival, yes — but not as important as water. When we understand this and live accordingly, our health naturally begins to change.
</div>
<h1>7. How Much Water Should You Drink?
<a name="chapter07"></a></h1>
<div>
When it comes to drinking water, most people drink as much as they feel like, whenever they feel like — but they do not drink water according to the body’s laws or according to its real needs. Let us think about how much water we should drink from the perspective of the body.
</div><div>
Doctors usually say: “You should drink as much water as the body loses in a day.”
</div><div>
Through breathing, sweating, urine, and stool, the body loses about 2 to 2½ liters of water daily. So they recommend drinking 2 to 2½ liters a day. By calculation, that seems correct. However, this measurement holds true only if a person eats nature-made foods:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Raw fruits</li>
<li>Raw vegetables</li>
<li>Nuts and seeds</li>
<li>Uncooked, unprocessed foods</li>
</ul>
<div>
But we do not live that way. We cook, fry, roast, and spice our foods — we eat in ways that are opposite to nature.
</div><div>
To wash away the impurities created by these tastes, and to cleanse the body internally, 2 to 2½ liters is simply not enough.
</div><div>
When cooking pots are burnt or heavily stained, we use more soap and more water to clean them. Likewise, when we put unnecessary strain on the body, the need for water increases.
</div><div>
In today’s lifestyle, people simply do not drink enough water.
</div><div>
Let us look at the signs the body gives when the water you drink is not sufficient:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Feeling warm or overheated</li>
<li>Dry mouth or dry lips</li>
<li>Thick, dark, or yellowish urine</li>
<li>Burning sensation while urinating</li>
<li>Strong smell in the bathroom after urination</li>
<li>Skin irritation or heat sensation when stepping into sunlight</li>
<li>Headache or heaviness under heat</li>
</ul>
<div>
When these symptoms appear, the body is telling you clearly: “I do not have enough water to meet my needs.”
</div><div>
Try drinking water until all these symptoms disappear. You will see how much your body actually requires. Based on our experience, 4 to 5 liters a day are necessary for most people to eliminate these symptoms completely.
</div><div>
According to natural laws, food and water should be in a 1:3 proportion — meaning the body needs three times more water than food. We eat roughly 2 kilograms of food daily; therefore, drinking around 5 liters of water is appropriate.
</div><div>
If 70% of the body is water, how can the body remain clean with just 7–8 glasses (about 2 liters) per day? Even the ancient Ayurvedic text Charaka Samhita, written nearly 3,000 years ago, recommends drinking 2½ liters of water before sunrise alone. Try drinking 5 liters of water a day, starting tomorrow. Your body will reveal wonderful changes.
</div><div>
Recommended quantity by age:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Children (1 to 15 years): 1 to 4 liters, depending on age</li>
<li>Age 16 to 60: About 5 liters daily</li>
<li>Age above 60: Up to 4 liters</li>
</ul>
<div>
Do not count the water in buttermilk, coconut water, soft drinks, or barley water. These do not replace plain water. Also, drinking the entire 5 liters at once, or at random times, will not help — it may cause more harm than good.
</div><div>
The body needs water for two separate purposes:
</div>
<ol>
<li>Morning cleansing on an empty stomach</li>
<li>Daytime needs for metabolism and elimination</li>
</ol>
<div>
So divide the 5 liters accordingly:
</div>
<ul>
<li>2½ liters on an empty stomach (early morning)</li>
<li>2½ liters throughout the day</li>
</ul>
<div>
Those who work hard in the sun or have severe constipation may drink up to 6 liters a day. Do not exceed 6 liters.
</div><div>
Let us first understand the importance of drinking water on an empty stomach.
</div>
<h1>8. How to Cleanse the Body Internally on an Empty Stomach?
<a name="chapter08"></a></h1>
<div>
The time between waking up and eating breakfast is called the empty-stomach period. During this period, one may drink 2 to 3 liters of water, depending on one’s capacity and comfort. Do not drink refrigerated water. If you have a copper vessel, pour water into it at night and drink that water in the morning — it is considered best.
</div><div>
People suffering from acidity, ulcers, gastritis, asthma, cough or phlegm, nasal congestion, or eosinophilia should warm the water slightly and drink all 5 liters that way until the problems subside.
</div><div>
<b>First Round of Water</b>
</div><div>
Upon waking, urinate if necessary. If your mouth feels unpleasant, rinse it once. Then begin drinking water.
</div><div>
Fill a bottle or tumbler completely, lift it high, and drink directly from it. Drink as much as you comfortably can in a single stretch. If you drink less than a liter, rest for 4–5 minutes and try to drink the remaining amount. If needed, rest again for 2–3 minutes.
</div><div>
Altogether — whether in one stretch or in two or three rounds, with 5–6 minutes in between — drink 1 to 1¼ liters, according to your capacity. (About 1¼ liters suits most people.)
</div><div>
For the first few days, some may feel nausea, dizziness, or even vomit. Do not worry. Those who feel discomfort may reduce the quantity slightly.
</div><div>
If after drinking water you watch TV, chat, read the newspaper, or start doing chores, your bowels will not move easily. If you want a complete evacuation immediately upon waking, follow the instructions exactly.
</div><div>
After drinking, keep your attention on the stomach and intestines (the lower abdominal area). Walk slowly for 5–10 minutes while observing that region. The weight of the water presses against the intestines and pushes the stool forward. If your mind does not wander, the intestinal nerves relax, allowing more stool to move forward easily. This mental focus is the secret behind smooth elimination.
</div><div>
Continue walking until the urge becomes strong. When you can no longer hold it, go to the toilet. The stool will pass in a single installment, without strain. You will feel immensely light — almost as if floating.
</div><div>
This first elimination removes the remnants of yesterday’s midday meal. Within 15–20 minutes, the water you drank enters the bloodstream and reaches the cells, soaking the accumulated impurities. Twenty minutes after drinking, you may begin your work or your exercises.
</div><div>
If someone exercises after the first elimination, deep breathing will carry more oxygen into the lungs, helping burn internal waste and dissolving it further in the water already absorbed.
</div><div>
<b>Second Round of Water</b>
</div><div>
Those who drank only 1 liter in the first round may drink the second round after one hour.<br>
Those who drank 1¼ liters should wait 1 hour 15 minutes.<br>
Those who drank 1½ liters should wait 1 hour 30 minutes.
</div><div>
Do not shorten this interval. If you drink too soon, the face may swell, the head may feel heavy, or dizziness may occur.
</div><div>
For the second round, again fill a bottle or tumbler and drink 1 to 1¼ liters, with a 5–6 minute gap if needed. After drinking, focus again on the intestines and walk, just as before.
</div><div>
Some may think, “The first elimination was plenty — what more could be there?” Or, “Once a day is enough, isn’t it?” This is a mistake.
</div><div>
The intestines are about one and a half meters long. The first elimination empties only about half a meter. The remaining stool travels towards the rectum within half an hour, becoming ready for expulsion.
</div><div>
Follow the method. Walk until the urge becomes strong. Then go.
</div><div>
The second elimination will be even smoother and slightly looser. For some it may come out almost like water. Do not be alarmed — this is merely some of the water you drank, cleaning the intestines thoroughly.
</div><div>
This second stool contains the remains of yesterday’s evening snack and dinner.
</div><div>
If these two rounds occur, consider your intestines completely clean.
</div><div>
Everyone knows how to clean their hands every day — but hardly anyone knows how to clean their intestines. Now that you know it, consider yourself fortunate.
</div><div>
Some may not get a second elimination. Do not worry — it will descend slowly on its own.
</div><div>
Within 15–20 minutes, the second round of water enters the bloodstream and dissolves earlier-soaked impurities, carrying them out through sweat and urine.
</div><div>
Together, the two rounds of water bathe your five liters of blood, your 70% water content, and your trillions of living cells from within.
</div><div>
Until now, we only knew how to bathe the outside of the body; today you have learned how to bathe the inside.
</div><div>
The body attempts each morning to expel waste between dawn and breakfast. By drinking water on an empty stomach, we ease its burden.
</div><div>
Let us drink the necessary water every morning and claim our health.
</div><div>
If someone drinks too little in the first two rounds, they may drink a third small round. But ideally, complete the cleansing in two rounds.
</div><div>
During travel or exceptional situations, you may relax the practice slightly.
</div><div>
Up to this point, we have learned how to perform this internal water cleansing ritual.
</div>

<h1>9. How to Drink Water During the Day?
<a name="chapter09"></a></h1>
<div>
The water we drink in the early morning suffices for the body’s needs until about 10 or 11 a.m. After that, the body requires water again.
</div><div>
Daytime water refers to the water you drink after breakfast until sunset. Water consumed during this period does not cleanse the body the way early-morning water does. Instead, it serves other important purposes:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Protects the body from heat during the day</li>
<li>Cools the warmth produced in the muscles while working</li>
<li>Supports the production of digestive juices</li>
</ul>
<div>
During the day, it is beneficial to drink 2½ liters of water. However, this water should not be drunk randomly or while eating. If consumed in a structured manner, the body benefits greatly.
</div><div>
Let us see how to do that.
</div><div>
<b>Third Round of Water</b>
</div><div>
After the second round of morning water, wait 25–30 minutes. Then you may eat or drink anything for breakfast.
</div><div>
Do not drink water while eating breakfast.
</div><div>
After eating, wait two hours before drinking the third round of water.
</div><div>
Do not drink the entire quantity at once. If you do, you will feel heavy and tired.
</div><div>
Drink this water in two or three portions — a glass now, a glass later, and so on.
</div><div>
Stop drinking water half an hour before lunch.
</div><div>
Do not drink water during lunch. Only if you need to swallow a tablet or if the throat is very dry, you may take a small sip.
</div><div>
<b>Fourth Round of Water</b>
</div><div>
Two hours after lunch, you may drink the fourth round — 1 to 1¼ liters, again in 2–3 portions, not all at once.
</div><div>
This water helps the intestines absorb the nutrients from the digested food.
</div><div>
Those aged 55–60 and above should avoid drinking water after 4–5 p.m., to prevent urination issues during the night.
</div><div>
<b>Fifth Round of Water (Optional)</b>
</div><div>
Not everyone needs this round.
</div><div>
The fifth round is useful for:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Those who drank less during the fourth round</li>
<li>Those who worked hard in the sun and sweated a lot</li>
<li>Young people with higher activity levels</li>
<li>Those who did not get a smooth second elimination in the morning</li>
<li>Those who want to attempt a third elimination</li>
</ul>
<div>
They may drink ¾ liter to 1 liter of water around 6 p.m., and try for a bowel movement.
</div><div>
At night, water is generally not required. However, if someone feels thirsty at 9–10 p.m., they may drink half a glass or one glass before going to bed.
</div>
<h1>10. What Harm Is There in Drinking Water While Eating?
<a name="chapter10"></a></h1>
<div>
Some people drink water and immediately start eating. Others drink water while eating, and some drink water right after eating.
</div><div>
All these habits interfere with proper digestion.
</div><div>
To digest the food we eat, the stomach secretes hydrochloric acid. When this acid mixes directly with the food, the food breaks down quickly into soft, digestible particles.
</div><div>
But if we drink water during meals, that water enters the stomach and dilutes the hydrochloric acid. (Whenever water is added to an acid, its strength and effectiveness decrease.) As a result, digestion takes twice as long as it should.
</div><div>
When the digestive acid becomes weak, the following issues commonly arise:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
<li>Burning sensations in the stomach</li>
<li>Indigestion</li>
<li>Food stagnation in the stomach for long hours</li>
<li>Fermentation and gas formation</li>
<li>Excessive belching</li>
<li>Bloating</li>
<li>The abdomen appearing stretched or distended</li>
</ul>
<div>
Drinking water during meals is unnatural.
</div><div>
When you eat fruits or raw vegetables, you chew them thoroughly, and they go down smoothly — you don’t feel choking, nor do you struggle to swallow.
</div><div>
Similarly, if you chew cooked food well — softening it completely with your teeth — and eat slowly, you won’t need water during meals.
</div><div>
For the first week or ten days, you may feel a little uncomfortable making this change, but gradually it becomes natural, and you will feel wonderfully light after meals.
</div><div>
<b>A Simple Analogy</b>
</div><div>
When grinding grains into flour on a stone grinder, we never pour water first and then try to grind the grains — the grains won’t crush properly.
</div><div>
Instead, we grind the grains first, and only afterwards add water if needed.
</div><div>
Treat your stomach the same way.
</div><div>
Let the food be well-ground by your teeth first. Let digestion begin naturally. Then, after sufficient time has passed, drink water — not during the meal.
</div>

<h1>11. Who Should Clean Their Intestines?
<a name="chapter11"></a></h1>
<div>
To cleanse the intestines, some people take tablets; others use castor oil; still others drink salt water.
</div><div>
Though these methods may clean the bowels to some extent, they often leave the body feeling weak or drained within a day or two. More importantly, none of these methods can thoroughly clean the intestines.
</div><div>
A human being regularly cleans everything he uses — his clothes, his household items, even his vehicles. Once in ten or twelve years, he even has the septic tank fully emptied and cleaned. Such fortune, however, has never been granted to our own intestines.
</div><div>
Even if waste accumulates in them by the bucketful, we remain unconcerned.
</div><div>
The health of the intestines determines the health of the entire body. Our immunity depends directly on the condition of our intestinal tract. To maintain that health, we must first clear out all the accumulated waste, and then ensure smooth bowel movements — two or three times a day — every day. If that happens, the intestines will never deteriorate.
</div><div>
Now let us consider who must cleanse their intestines:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Those who drink water in the recommended manner, focus their mind, yet still do not get a smooth bowel movement</li>
<li>Those who have bowel movements but only after great strain</li>
<li>Those suffering from long-standing constipation</li>
<li>Those whose stools are dry, hard, or pellet-like</li>
<li>Those with heavy mucus or coating inside the intestines</li>
<li>Those with amoebiasis, threadworms, or tapeworms</li>
<li>Those with excessive gas trouble</li>
<li>Those who never feel genuine hunger</li>
<li>Those who frequently experience abdominal pain</li>
<li>Those whose stools carry a strong foul odour</li>
</ul>
<div>
All such individuals should first cleanse their intestines thoroughly, and then follow both the dietary rules and the water-intake rules alongside.
</div>

<h1>12. How to Clean the Intestines?
<a name="chapter12"></a></h1>
<div>
The cleanliness of the intestines determines the cleanliness of the entire body. And among all methods to clean them, the enema is the simplest, most inexpensive, side-effect-free, and the most effective way to cleanse thoroughly.
</div><div>
Please don’t say “Ugh!” at the word enema. We feel no embarrassment carrying around a whole bucketful of waste inside us, yet somehow feel embarrassed about cleaning it out? Strange, isn’t it!
</div><div>
Do you know that in the privacy of your own bathroom, without anyone seeing, you can clean your intestines easily and neatly using an enema? Then why delay? Go and buy an enema can right away!
</div><div>
A home that has an enema can is as good as a home with a doctor — remember that.
</div><div>
Let us now learn how to take an enema properly.
</div>
<ul>
<li>Always take an enema on an empty stomach. If you have already drunk some water, wait at least half an hour before doing it.</li>
<li>Fill the enema can completely with warm water. Never mix any medicines or soap into the water.</li>
<li>Apply a little coconut oil to the nozzle that goes into the anus.</li>
<li>Lie down on your side on the bathroom floor, insert the tube gently about one or two inches into the anus.</li>
<li>Then either hang the enema can about one meter high, or hold it up with your hand. The height allows the water to flow into the rectum.</li>
<li>Once the water has emptied from the can, remove the tube and go sit on the toilet. It may take 10–15 minutes for everything to come out.</li>
<li>If needed, stand up occasionally and press gently on the lower abdomen with your hands, then sit again—this helps the water and loosened stool come out more easily.</li>
</ul>
<div>
After two or three days of practice, most people can comfortably take two cans of water.
</div><div>
Use plain warm water enemas once every morning for 3–4 days. After that, it is beneficial to take an enema with neem-leaf water:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Take a handful of neem leaves, boil them in 2 liters of water</li>
<li>Let the water cool to warm temperature</li>
<li>Filter it, pour it into the enema can, and administer as usual</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
This neem-water enema helps expel worms, parasites, and harmful microbes from the intestines.
</div><div>
Neem enemas can be done for 3–4 consecutive days. After that, continue with warm-water enemas for another 2–3 days. Stop once you feel thoroughly clean.
</div><div>
Depending on the need, one may continue daily enemas for a week, ten days, or even twenty days. There is no harm in doing it for any number of days. It does not become a habit.
</div><div>
Anyone — from a two-year-old child to a very elderly person — can safely take an enema.
</div><div>
Please do not hesitate to buy an enema can for your home. It is incredibly helpful.
</div><div>
And now, allow me to express a small personal wish — please don’t refuse it:
</div><div>
When you marry off your daughter and send her to her new home, you consider it your duty to give her rice container, stove, utensils, and all essentials. Along with those, please spend just a hundred more rupees and place one enema can in that container.
</div><div>
It will be there whenever your daughter needs it — and you will also save your son-in-law the expense of buying another one!
</div>
<h1>13. Foods That Keep the Intestines Clean
<a name="chapter13"></a></h1>
<div>
Any food that contains fiber helps clean the intestines daily and ensures smooth bowel movements.
</div><div>
Take an orange, for example: You chew the segment, swallow the juice, and then spit out the fibrous pulp from your mouth. That fibrous pulp is fiber.
</div><div>
Now imagine swallowing both the juice and the pulp. Just as the juice enters the bloodstream and provides nourishment, the fibrous pulp travels through your stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, scrubbing and cleaning them like a brush — carrying away dead cells and unnecessary waste, and finally leaving the body as stool.
</div><div>
Without fiber, the intestines cannot remain clean, and proper bowel movement does not happen.
</div><div>
This fiber is naturally present in all unprocessed foods given by nature.
</div><div>
All vegetables contain fiber. It is best to cook tender vegetables without peeling them. Most of the fiber lies in the skin. If you peel the vegetables and cook them after scraping them smooth, you cannot expect a proper bowel movement the next morning — it will be hard and stuck like a lump.
</div><div>
All fruits contain fiber. Leafy greens have abundant fiber. Coconut contains plenty of fiber too. Sprinkling grated coconut on curries before serving is very beneficial.
</div><div>
When I say you should swallow fiber, please don’t misunderstand — this does not mean chewing on sugarcane stalks or fibrous stems and swallowing the entire stringy pulp like an over-enthusiastic student of Paramānandayya! Such fiber is not useful for us.
</div><div>
<b>Foods That Block the Intestines</b>
</div><div>
Foods that have no fiber do not move properly through the intestines. They do not keep the intestinal lining healthy. They do not help remove dead microbes.
</div><div>
The worst among these is white rice — it contains zero fiber. We are damaging our intestines by eating such rice every day.
</div><div>
Other fiberless foods include:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Maida (Refined wheat flour)</li>
<li>Sooji Rava (Bombay Rava)</li>
<li>Rice Rava (Rice Semolina or Coarsely Ground Rice)</li>
<li>Polished wheat flour</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
<li>Sweets</li>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Cakes</li>
<li>Noodles</li>
<li>Cool drinks</li>
<li>Ice creams</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>All kinds of meat (even fish)</li>
<li>Chocolates</li>
<li>Biscuits</li>
</ul>
<div>
People who eat these regularly accumulate faults in their intestines. Constipation becomes chronic. Children should also be kept away from these foods.
</div><div>
<b>Foods to Relieve Constipation</b>
</div><div>
Those who are currently cleaning their intestines using enema should not eat boiled breakfast items or sprouted seeds in the morning. They should only eat fruits for breakfast.
</div><div>
Good options include:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Papaya</li>
<li>Sapota</li>
<li>Pomegranate</li>
<li>Dates (10–15 pieces)</li>
<li>Any fruit except bananas</li>
</ul>
<div>
If they also have diabetes, they may choose:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Guava</li>
<li>Pomegranate</li>
<li>Sweet lime</li>
<li>Sour jujube</li>
<li>Other mildly sour fruits</li>
</ul>
<div>
After 10–15 days, once the intestines are clean, they may stop eating only fruits and begin eating sprouted seeds again.
</div><div>
Those with constipation, gas, low appetite, or similar issues should make the above changes.
</div><div>
<b>A Suitable Lunch for Good Bowel Movements</b>
</div><div>
At lunch, prepare rotis made with kneaded wheat flour (without oil) — 3 to 4 rotis.
</div><div>
Fill each roti generously with curry — half a kilogram of curry or even more, if you can. Cook curries in a slightly watery consistency so that you can eat more of them.
</div><div>
After finishing the rotis with curry, you may eat boiled brown rice (unpolished rice) or wheat rava rice with a little curd or buttermilk.
</div><div>
<b>A Suitable Dinner</b>
</div><div>
If you don’t prefer wheat rotis at night, you may make rotis from jowar or ragi flour, again eating them with plenty of curry. Avoid taking curd rice at night.
</div><div>
Once constipation improves, those who do not want rotis may eat brown rice or wheat rice instead.
</div>

<h1>14. How Does the Body Feel When It Is Clean Inside?
<a name="chapter14"></a></h1>
<div>
Animals may appear unclean on the outside, yet the inside of their bodies remains remarkably clean — even those creatures that live by eating meat.
</div><div>
In contrast, humans may appear perfectly groomed, fragrant, and neat from the outside, but inside, no creature on earth harbors as much internal impurity as we do.
</div><div>
You may wonder: How can one determine how clean or unclean the inside of the body is? For this, you need not spend any money, pay any doctor’s fee, and undergo any blood tests or X-rays. 
</div><div>
There are five simple indicators.
</div><div>
<b>1. Breath and Saliva at Dawn</b>
</div><div>
On waking in the morning, if your mouth has no foul smell and your saliva tastes fresh and pleasant, you may understand that the 70% water content within your body is clean.
</div><div>
<b>2. Clean Tongue</b>
</div><div>
If your tongue is not coated, not bitter, and appears clean, your digestive system too is in a clean state.
</div><div>
<b>3. Clean Sweat</b>
</div><div>
Even without bathing or applying soap, if your sweat does not carry a foul odor, your skin is clean internally.
</div><div>
<b>4. Clean Urine</b>
</div><div>
Whenever you urinate, even if you do not pour water afterward, your bathroom should not emit an unpleasant smell. If your urine is always clear and pale, you may know that your five liters of blood are clean.
</div><div>
<b>5. Clean Bowel Movement</b>
</div><div>
Whenever you pass stool, if it drops away smoothly, without sticking to the pan, without leaving stains, without any smell, you may understand that the billions of cells inside you are clean and healthy.
</div><div>
If all five of these are free from odor, know that your inner body is living in a state of purity and peace.
</div><div>
If foul odors arise in any of these, realize that the atmosphere inside resembles a sewage pit.
</div><div>
Just as tasting a single grain of rice tells you whether the entire pot has cooked, these five signs reveal the health of all your cells and organs.
</div><div>
<b>Why Animals Don’t Smell — and Why We Do</b>
</div><div>
Animals never scrape their tongues. They do not brush their teeth, gargle, use soap, powder, or perfume. They do not wash after passing stool or urine. Yet none of the five odors arise from within them.
</div><div>
That inner purity itself is their protection — they do not fear organ failure, age-related diseases, genetic weakness, or environmental pollution.
</div><div>
We humans, on the other hand, wash ourselves repeatedly from morning to night, yet still struggle with odor. We hide it with powders, perfumes, phenyls — deceiving ourselves. How long will this go on? How many years have we lived this way? Will this continue all our lives? Think about it.
</div><div>
Just as those ruled by anger and desire are unfit for liberation, those whose bodies give off foul smells are unfit for health.
</div><div>
We alone are responsible for the odor within us. We must also take responsibility to cleanse it.
</div><div>
A person who can transform a swamp into a garden can certainly turn his own body into a beautiful dwelling — if only he desires to.
</div><div>
<b>How Long Does It Take to Become Odor-Free?</b>
</div><div>
You may wonder whether years of effort are needed. In my own case, having cleaned my body daily from within for nearly ten years and eating mostly natural foods, all five odors disappeared within five or six months.
</div><div>
I no longer scrape my tongue. I do not use soap, toothpaste, or powder. I do not use phenyl in the bathroom. Yet my body remains clean — inside and outside — all day, every day.
</div><div>
Only through experience does one understand how closely purity and health are connected.
</div><div>
<b>How You Can Achieve This Cleanliness</b>
</div><div>
If you wish to enjoy such inner purity:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Drink 4–5 liters of water daily</li>
<li>Have 2–3 smooth bowel movements each day</li>
<li>Do some regular exercise</li>
<li>Eat 50–60% natural, uncooked food every day</li>
<li>Avoid meat</li>
</ul><div>
If you do this, I hope you too will soon experience this deep inner cleanliness.
</div>

<h1>15. This Must Become Our Habit
<a name="chapter15"></a></h1>
<div>
So far, we have all learned something about water, bowel movement, and internal cleanliness. If anyone still has doubts, or wishes to know more details and health secrets, I have written everything thoroughly in Neeru–Meeru and Sukha Virechanamtho Sukhamaya Jeevanam. Reading those books will give you even deeper clarity.
</div><div>
Waking up early in the morning, drinking water, and going for a bowel movement — that used to be our traditional practice. We must bring that tradition back and make the entire society aware of it again.
</div><div>
First, teach this to your own family.
</div><div>
If, from tomorrow, your family members wake up and ask: “Hey! Is the coffee ready?” — stop giving them coffee. Instead, keep a vessel of water ready and hand it to them yourself.
</div><div>
If your children ask in the morning, “Mom, is breakfast ready?” you must immediately ask, “Did you finish your motion?” Only if they say yes, should you serve breakfast.
</div><div>
In this way, let your entire family cultivate one good habit after another, while gradually letting go of harmful habits. Let everyone try to live a healthy and joyful life.
</div><div>
Let us prove that our health lies in our own hands. Let us build a healthy society together.
</div>
