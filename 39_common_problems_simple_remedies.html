<h1>What Is the Right Treatment?</h1>
<div>
Today, medical science has advanced tremendously — and it needs to advance even further. It is extremely necessary for society. With the welfare of humanity in mind, many great thinkers have developed various systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Allopathy, Homeopathy, Unani, and others. All of these have benefited humankind greatly. They provide relief and comfort to people who approach them in pain.
</div><div>
For a given problem, whichever medical system we follow, it may give complete relief, partial relief, or sometimes no relief at all. In some cases, instead of improvement, side effects may also occur. Whatever benefit these systems provide, they become necessary only after a disease appears. People who are not ill do not approach any medical system. These systems are not able to help us before a disease occurs.
</div><div>
For example, if one takes a tablet after stomach pain begins, the pain may subside. But if a healthy person takes the same tablet in advance to prevent stomach pain, it will not work and may even cause harm. While most medical systems work in this way, natural therapy works very differently.
</div><div>
For instance, to relieve stomach pain, natural treatment involves giving an enema, cleansing the intestines, and providing proper food. If a person who does not have stomach pain practices the same method as a preventive measure, the intestines remain clean and the problem does not arise in the future. In other words, every treatment that helps a sick person recover also helps a healthy person remain disease-free. It works like a double-edged sword.
</div><div>
A truly correct treatment is like repairing a hole in a copper vessel with copper itself. Just as that is the most appropriate repair, natural treatments perfectly suit this naturally created body. Treatment and body merge seamlessly — like milk mixing with milk — without conflict. This means there are no side effects.
</div><div>
By using such natural methods to manage common problems, the body benefits greatly. Whenever the body faces a problem, we should first attempt to resolve it naturally. If, despite this effort, the problem persists or worsens, turning to other medical systems is not wrong. However, what we usually do is the opposite — we rely on medicines first and act against the body’s natural processes.
</div><div>
From now on, if we begin attempting to resolve bodily problems naturally, we will gain far greater benefits. This is the reason these treatment methods are being written about. There is no need to practice natural therapy for a short time and then stop. This is not medicine in the conventional sense. Whether one is sick or healthy, the entire family can adopt these good habits and improve their health. With this intention, these two volumes have been written, and it is hoped they will be accepted with an open and positive mind.
</div><div>
Whenever animals face any problem, they immediately try to resolve it naturally. If they feel uncomfortable, they eat something unsuitable and promptly vomit to relieve themselves. If they do not feel hunger, they fast until hunger returns. Treating themselves in this way is simply a part of their life. They do not learn this from books, nor does anyone teach them.
</div><div>
We too are born with the same kind of body and the same natural intelligence. In addition, we possess greater awareness and knowledge. Because of this, we should behave even more intelligently than animals and make sincere efforts to resolve our problems easily. If we know the natural ways to heal our body but fail to use them, the loss is entirely ours.
</div><div>
By using what is available in our own homes, everyone can take advantage of this opportunity to heal themselves. It is hoped that all will use this approach to live with long life, good health, peace, happiness, and joy.

<h1>1. How to Get Rid of Cracked Heels
<a name="chapter01"></a></h1>
<div>
Everyone wants their feet to look beautiful, but only a few actually achieve it. In the quest for smooth, attractive feet, many people apply various creams after seeing them advertised on television. Since the feet are the farthest part of the body, proper blood circulation often does not reach them. As a result, the skin on the feet becomes hard and rough. This problem becomes more severe in winter, especially for overweight people and those with poor blood circulation.
</div><div>
Cracks mainly occur because the feet are not cleaned properly. Dirt accumulates inside the cracks, preventing new skin from forming. The existing skin becomes harder and keeps splitting further. However, feet can be made very smooth and attractive within 10–15 days.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Apply coconut oil or castor oil to the feet and soak them in hot water for 20–25 minutes. During this time, the dirt dissolves in the hot water and the hardened skin softens.
</li><li>
Take the feet out and scrub the cracked areas gently using a clothes-washing brush. The softened dead skin will peel off easily. When this dead skin is removed, the body naturally produces new skin in that area.
</li><li>
Wipe the feet clean and apply a small amount of coconut oil again. This keeps the skin soft and prevents it from hardening throughout the day.
</li><li>
Those who can wear shoes regularly will find that their feet remain soft and cracks do not develop.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
For those who do not have cracks but want to prevent them — apply coconut oil before bathing twice a week, scrub the feet lightly with a brush while bathing to remove dirt, and after the bath, apply a light layer of coconut oil. This will keep the feet clean, soft, and crack-free.
</div>
<h1>2. How to Relieve Trapped Gas
<a name="chapter02"></a></h1>
<div>
For some people, gas gets trapped tightly in the abdomen and does not pass out. This creates a very uncomfortable and helpless situation, where one keeps wishing that passing gas would bring relief. But even after waiting and trying repeatedly, it sometimes does not come out. When it finally does, the sense of relief is immense.
</div><div>
The main reasons for gas getting trapped include holding urine for a long time (until the bladder is full), wearing very tight clothing around the waist, and stool reaching the rectum but getting stuck there. Similarly, gas can get trapped in the chest or abdominal area without coming out as a burp. Even when one tries to burp, it does not happen.
</div><div>
When gas gets trapped like this and needs to be released freely, the following remedies can help.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
First, loosen your belt and clothing around the waist.
</li><li>
Even if you do not feel the urge to urinate, go and sit on the toilet. During that time, the gas often shifts and is released.
</li><li>
If gas is trapped in the upper part of the body, sit in Vajrasana — sitting upright with the waist straight, in any comfortable seated position. This helps release the gas.
</li><li>
If it is still tightly held, take 5–10 deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling forcefully. These movements help the gas come out.
</li><li>
If it still does not pass, slowly sip hot water, like drinking coffee. The warmth increases intestinal movement and helps release the gas.
</li><li>
If discomfort persists, apply a little oil on the chest or below the navel and place a hot water compress. This usually brings significant relief.
</li><li>
If the problem still continues, you may take medication after consulting a doctor.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
At that moment, try whichever of the above remedies is most convenient and available to you.
</div>
<h1>3. How to Prevent Sunstroke
<a name="chapter03"></a></h1>
<div>
When we move about in the sun, the body protects the skin from heat by evaporating the water within it and thereby cooling the skin. For the body to carry out this process, there must be an adequate amount of water inside. If people go out into the sun without sufficient water in the body, some of the internal water gets used up for cooling the skin, resulting in an overall shortage of water in the body.
</div><div>
When body water decreases, blood circulation to the head is affected, and the water content in the blood also reduces. Since the head is a sensitive part of the body, this can lead to symptoms such as dizziness, loss of balance, and light-headedness. If one wishes to move about in the scorching summer heat as comfortably as walking under moonlight — even during peak summer days — the following precautions are essential.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Whenever you go out, carry water with you and drink 2–3 glasses every hour, especially when the stomach is empty.
</li><li>
When you feel thirsty, drink only water. Do not consume other beverages, as they do not truly quench thirst and do not enter the bloodstream as quickly as water does.
</li><li>
Even during peak summer heat, ensure that urination remains smooth and regular by drinking sufficient water.
</li><li>
Those who spend time outdoors in the sun should wear white cotton clothes, as they reflect heat and help keep the body cool.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>4. How to Reduce Fatigue
<a name="chapter04"></a></h1>
<div>
These days, the stamina seen in elderly people aged 70 or 80 is often not found in those aged 40 or 50. Compared to people in their forties and fifties, even young adults of marriageable age seem to have less endurance. Compared to them, children of a younger age appear even weaker. If this trend continues, the future may bring days when people will not even have the strength to eat on their own and will need to be fed.
</div><div>
The reason for this is that people are consuming foods that lack real strength. They eat mainly for taste, not for strength or health. If one wishes to work 15–18 hours a day without losing stamina, the following should be practiced.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b> 
</div>
<ol>
<li>Among all foods, coconut is one of the most strength-giving. Eating one whole tender coconut in the morning, like a breakfast item (along with sprouts), is highly beneficial.
</li><li>
Dates provide a large amount of energy in a very short time. Eating about 20 dates a day, either in the morning along with coconut or in the evening with fruits, brings quick and noticeable benefits.
</li><li>
Cooking and eating unpolished rice for both meals daily helps improve stamina within 10–15 days. By following these three practices, one can regain full stamina and strength within a month.
</li><li>
If sudden fatigue occurs and dizziness is felt, immediately take 3–4 teaspoons of honey and slowly lick it. Within 5–10 minutes, strength and alertness will return.</li>
</ol> 

<h1>5. How to Reduce Joint Pain
<a name="chapter05"></a></h1>
<div>
Joint pains are appearing even before people reach the age of 40 or 50. The common explanation given is that the lubricating fluid in the joints has reduced and that the bones have worn out due to age. Instead of thinking about what mistakes we are making that cause this lubrication to disappear, we simply blame age.
</div><div>
If the human body is designed to function for 100 years, why should the joints fail at 40 or 50? Even an elephant has a lifespan of about 100 years. Despite carrying such enormous weight, why does an elephant not suffer from joint pain, swelling, cartilage wear, or loss of lubrication? The elephant knows exactly what it should eat. We, on the other hand, know only how to eat everything indiscriminately.
</div><div>
Because we eat only cooked foods, the body gradually loses its natural ability to produce joint lubrication and to prevent wear and tear. On top of that, eating cooked food with salt causes excess salt to accumulate in the joints. This salt slowly damages the joints and destroys the cartilage. As long as one continues to consume salt, joints do not truly recover. Many people undergo various treatments without giving up salt; the result is only loss of money, while the pain does not completely go away and normal walking does not return.
</div><div>
Whether one wants to prevent joint pain or completely eliminate it, giving up salt is unavoidable.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b> 
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Every morning, avoid coffee and drink green leafy vegetable juice around 7 or 8 a.m. The natural minerals in this juice help restore lubrication between the joints.
</li><li>
For breakfast, sprouted grains must be eaten without fail. Including sesame seeds along with the sprouts helps prevent joint wear.
</li><li>
For lunch and dinner, cook food without salt and eat the vegetables wrapped in wheat rotis. In the evening, eating raw vegetables instead of cooked ones is even better.
</li><li>
Apply sesame oil to the knees and place a hot water compress for about 15 minutes. After that, apply wet black soil (clay) on the knees, wrap with a cloth, and keep it for 15–20 minutes before washing it off. This provides relief. Those who do not have clay can simply keep a wet cloth wrapped around the knees.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
If practiced as described, relief is seen within 2–3 months. For those who have been suffering from joint pain for 5–6 years, it will take much longer. If the condition has become chronic, even these methods may not give complete results. Therefore, if one becomes alert at the very beginning, joint pain can be completely eliminated.
</div>
<h1>6. How to Fall Asleep Easily and Sleep Well
<a name="chapter06"></a></h1>
<div>
After going to bed, people keep tossing from side to side for one or two hours, and sleep comes only much later. Nowadays, hardly anyone goes to sleep before 11 or 12 at night. Even small children who drink milk do not go to bed until 11:30 p.m., only after all the TV serials are over.
</div><div>
Sleep means complete rest. For the body to truly rest, all its work must be finished. If you complete all bodily activities and then lie down, sleep comes immediately. But that is not what we are doing. We eat at 10 or 11 at night and then go to bed. Externally, we may be lying down, but internally all the organs are busy digesting that food. Even though you lie down, the body is still working, so sleep does not come quickly. It does not come because the body itself is not ready to rest.
</div><div>
If, instead, you eat early in the evening and go to bed after digestion is complete, both the body and the mind slip into sleep effortlessly. Many people may not immediately agree with what I am saying. Practice it for 10 days and then decide.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b> 
</div>
<ol>
<li> Try to finish dinner by 6:00 or 6:30 p.m. every day. In the first 8–10 days, sleep may not come easily at night, but after that, by 9 or 10 p.m. you will start yawning and will not be able to resist sleep.
</li><li>
If sleep does not come due to physical fatigue, leg pain, or foot pain, sit on a chair and soak your feet in hot water. Keep them immersed for 15–20 minutes, then remove them and wash your feet with cool water.
</li><li>
Sometimes, if excessive thoughts disturb the mind and prevent sleep, put one drop of honey into each eye before going to bed. The honey causes a slight burning sensation in the eyes. Your mind immediately shifts its focus from worries and thoughts to this sensation. Within 5–10 minutes, while observing that sensation, you will drift into sleep. If you do this every night, the eyes may get used to honey in 5–6 days and the burning sensation will stop. Therefore, use this method occasionally. There is no harm in doing so.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>7. How to Reduce Excessive Bleeding
<a name="chapter07"></a></h1>
<div>
Menstrual periods may arrive regularly every month, but the bleeding can continue for 8 to 10 days. This problem is commonly seen in women who have anemia, or who are under high mental stress. In some cases, excessive bleeding occurs due to uterine growths (fibroids). In others, it may be caused by improper functioning of the endocrine glands.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b> 
</div>
<ol>
<li>
During the days of bleeding, break ice into small pieces, wrap them in a cloth, and place the cloth over the lower abdomen. Keeping it there for 15–20 minutes is sufficient. (You can turn or adjust the cloth in between if needed.)
The cold causes changes in blood circulation, which helps reduce bleeding. This can be done 3–4 times a day.
</li><li>
Taking a hip bath (sitz bath) daily for 1–2 months can bring complete relief. Use either a plastic tub or a cement tub (about 2 feet high and 3 feet wide). Fill it with water, sit in it resting the hips inside while letting the legs remain outside. The water should cover the area from the lower abdomen to the thighs, while the rest of the body stays dry. Sit like this for 20 minutes, then get up.
This bath should be done only on an empty stomach.
</li><li>
Following dietary practices that help improve blood quality and strength is also beneficial.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
If the problem does not reduce even after trying these methods for 2–3 months, it is advisable to consult a doctor.
</div>

<h1>8. How to Reduce Post-Meal Breathlessness
<a name="chapter08"></a></h1>
<div>
One might think, “Isn’t it enough if I just eat lightly?” But many people say that once they sit down with a full plate, they are unable to get up that easily. While eating, they not only eat to fullness but also drink plenty of water along with the meal. As a result, the stomach becomes completely full, and this heaviness presses against the lower portions of the lungs, compressing them by about 25–30 percent.
</div><div>
To digest food, the body requires more oxygen. When, at the same time, the lungs are partially compressed, the body does not receive enough air. Because of this lack of oxygen, breathlessness after eating begins soon after the meal.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>It is better to eat sitting on the floor rather than at a table. When you sit on the floor, the abdomen naturally folds slightly, reducing its capacity by about a quarter. Even if you eat fully, when you get up there is some natural space created without your noticing, and breathlessness does not occur.</li>
<li>Avoid drinking water while eating. Instead, drink water up to half an hour before the meal, and after eating, wait for two hours, then drink water slowly, one glass at a time. This prevents post-meal breathlessness.</li>
<li>Be careful not to fill the stomach beyond 80 percent of its capacity.</li>
</ol>

<h1>9. How to Get Relief from Dust Allergy
<a name="chapter09"></a></h1>
<div>
Some people start sneezing, experience nasal congestion, or feel an itching or irritation in the throat as soon as they step out of the house and come in contact with smoke or dust. In some cases, itching in the eyes and redness of the face also occur. Such people try to protect themselves by avoiding dust and smoke as much as possible. But how long can one stay away from them? Avoidance is not the real solution. Instead, the body should be strengthened so that it can cleanse itself naturally.
</div><div>
People who regularly work in dusty environments often remain healthy. It is usually those who rarely step out of sheltered, indoor environments who suffer more from such problems. Those who do physically active work every day rarely face these issues.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>It is good to drink about 5 liters of lukewarm water every day.</li>
<li>Practicing deep-breathing pranayama for 20–30 minutes every morning helps clear infections or impurities inside the nasal passages.</li>
<li>Applying a little oil to the face and taking steam inhalation at least once a day provides relief.</li>
<li>Eating natural, wholesome foods regularly strengthens the immune system quickly and helps prevent dust allergies from recurring.</li>
</ol>

<h1>10. How to Reduce Bleeding During Bowel Movements
<a name="chapter10"></a></h1>
<div>
This problem occurs frequently in people who suffer from constipation. It is more common among those who drink very little water and consume a lot of pickles and non-vegetarian food. In people who eat food lacking fiber, the stool becomes hard like stones. To expel this hard stool, many people strain excessively while using the toilet. During such straining, the hard stool scrapes and tears the edges of the intestines and blood vessels. As the stool comes out, harmful bacteria and disease-causing germs multiply in large numbers. These germs damage the intestinal environment. Due to this infection, the blood vessels in the intestines rupture, leading to frequent bleeding.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink 5–6 liters of clean water daily. Even after drinking sufficient water, if bowel movements are not smooth, perform an enema daily for 7–8 days.
</li><li>
Completely avoid straining in the toilet. Drink water, remain calm, and wait until you feel a strong natural urge to pass stools. Going only when the urge is strong eliminates the need to strain.
</li><li>
To relieve constipation in the intestines, eat large quantities of vegetables daily, preferably with rotis. After eating rotis, you may eat rice with curd. Vegetables should be cooked lightly without removing the skins. Following the same pattern in the evening is also beneficial.
</li><li>
In the morning, it is best to eat only fruits. For 15–20 days, avoid sprouted grains and stay on fruits alone. Fruits should be swallowed without chewing excessively, which is considered beneficial.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h1>11. How to Reduce Lower Back Pain
<a name="chapter11"></a></h1>
<div>
From the neck down to the hip region, the vertebrae of the spine are stacked one over the other. Just as there is a layer of cement between bricks, there is a soft, cushion-like structure between each vertebra. This is called a disc. When we lift or carry weight, these discs act like springs, absorbing pressure and preventing the load from falling directly on the vertebrae. Just as springs in a vehicle protect passengers from jerks while driving over potholes, the discs protect our spine in a similar manner.
</div><div>
People who sit bent forward for long hours in offices, those who sit in awkward postures, those who sleep on very soft mattresses, and those who travel frequently on scooters are more likely to put continuous pressure on these discs. As a result, problems such as lower back pain and pain radiating to the legs may develop. In addition, heavy physical work can strain the muscles of the lower back. This leads to pain in the middle of the lower back, which worsens on bending forward and improves with rest.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Avoid sponge or very soft mattresses. It is better to sleep on a thin, firm mattress or quilt.
</li><li>
Apply oil to the lower back and place a hot-water bag (rubber bag filled with hot water) over it twice daily. This gives relief to the muscles.
</li><li>
Avoid activities that require bending forward. Wherever you sit, make it a habit to sit upright.
</li><li>
Every day, completely avoid exercises that involve bending forward. Practice only backward-bending postures, such as Bhujangasana (cobra pose), Dhanurasana (bow pose), and Ushtrasana (camel pose). If possible, practicing these twice a day helps the pain subside more quickly.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>12. How to Improve Eyesight
<a name="chapter12"></a></h1>
<div>
Earlier, when eyesight weakened, people felt it was a sign of old age. These days, eyesight is deteriorating even before childhood is fully over. There are living beings that live for 400 to 1,000 years, and despite such long lifespans, none of them ever need spectacles. When we cook, strain, over-process, and dry our food, and then add salt and oils, the nutritional needs of the eyes are no longer met through food. Instead of resting the eyes by looking at natural greenery, we strain them by constantly viewing bright, flashy, and colorful images, which gradually damages vision. The solution to this problem lies in returning to a more natural way of living.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Every morning, drink vegetable juice with a generous amount of carrot added.
</li><li>
If possible, add drumstick (moringa) leaves daily to vegetable juice and drink it. Alternatively, once or twice a week, prepare drumstick leaf juice separately, dilute it well with water, and drink it mixed with honey and lemon juice.
</li><li>
At lunchtime every day, make it a point to cook and eat leafy vegetables.
</li><li>
If you have the opportunity to grow leafy greens yourself at home, it is even better to add those fresh greens daily to vegetable juice and drink it.
</li><li>
Eat seasonal fruits in their respective seasons — at least 20 percent of your daily intake should be fruits.
</li><li>
Keep salt as far away as possible. Salt damages the delicate blood vessels in the eyes very quickly.

<h1>13. How to Relieve Stomach Pain
<a name="chapter13"></a></h1>
<div>
When stomach pain occurs, people usually take a painkiller to suppress the pain and then ignore the abdomen. As a result, the pain keeps recurring. This problem is seen more often in children and in people who suffer from severe constipation.
</div><div>
If we look at the causes, after eating a heavy, full meal, the weight of the food presses on the intestines, and in some people this pressure causes pain after eating. Sometimes pain occurs even after passing stools, especially when evacuation is incomplete. When there is a lot of mucus accumulated in the intestines, its movement can also cause pain. Trapped gas in the intestines may lead to abdominal pain as well. Whatever the cause, the goal should be not only to relieve the pain but also to remove the accumulated waste that is the root cause of the pain.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Whenever there is pain, apply oil over the painful area and use a hot water bag as a fomentation 2–3 times a day.
</li><li>
Perform an enema twice daily for 2–3 days; this helps clear all the waste from the intestines.
</li><li>
Avoid rice and cooked vegetables for two days and stay only on liquid foods such as fruit juices, fruits, buttermilk, coconut water, honey water, and plain water.
</li><li>
Every day, before the enema, place a wet cloth or a mud pack on the lower abdomen for about 20 minutes; this helps the stool move more easily.
</li><li>
To prevent constipation from recurring, eat the right food, drink plenty of water, and ensure that bowel movements occur 2–3 times a day — once this is achieved, the pain will not return.
</li>
</ol>
<h1>14. How to Relieve Itching
<a name="chapter14"></a></h1>
<div>
In people who suffer from constipation, waste is not eliminated properly. Instead of leaving the body, it gets reabsorbed and eventually tries to exit through the skin. In those who do not sweat adequately, this waste remains trapped in the skin and leads to various kinds of allergies. Some people experience itching, others develop rashes, and in some cases it appears as boils or eruptions. Whatever the form, itching will not subside unless both the body internally and the skin externally are properly cleansed.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Every day, before bathing, apply lemon juice to the itchy area, wait for 5–10 minutes, and then take a bath.
</li><li>
After bathing, applying a little coconut oil to the itchy areas provides relief.
</li><li>
If the itching is severe, it is good to take steam therapy for the skin twice a week to help cleanse the accumulated impurities.
</li><li>
Drinking about 5 liters of clean water daily helps purify the blood. Adequate water intake significantly reduces allergies.
</li><li>
Take care to ensure that constipation is completely eliminated.
</li><li>
If about 50% of the daily diet consists only of fruits and fruit juices, the blood purifies quickly and internal toxins are removed.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>15. How to Reduce Snoring
<a name="chapter15"></a></h1>
<div>
For some people, snoring becomes so troublesome that husband and wife are forced to sleep in separate rooms. Snoring is more common in people who are overweight, those with a protruding abdomen, and those who eat and go straight to bed.
</div><div>
In overweight individuals, because the body has become bulky, millions of additional cells are formed. To keep all these cells alive, the amount of air they breathe is often insufficient. During the day, because there is movement and activity, the lungs are able to supply more oxygen. But during sleep, the lungs function at a reduced level. On top of that, when such people eat a heavy meal and lie down, the weight of the stomach presses against the lungs, closing them by about 25–30 percent and further restricting airflow.
</div><div>
As a result, the air entering through the nose alone is not enough, so the body tries to draw in air through the mouth as well. When large amounts of air rush in through the mouth, various sounds are produced — this is what we hear as snoring.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Eat the evening meal while there is still daylight. By the time you go to bed, the food should be fully digested and the stomach should be empty.
</li><li>
In the evening, if you avoid cooked foods and eat only fruits, this reduces the body’s demand for oxygen and allows breathing to remain smooth and natural.
</li><li>
Follow a diet that helps reduce body weight and gradually lose excess weight. When this is done, snoring reduces significantly within 10–15 days.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>16. How to Reduce Burning Sensation in the Stomach
<a name="chapter16"></a></h1>
<div>
This condition is commonly called acidity. For some people, the burning sensation comes when it is time to eat; for others, it occurs on an empty stomach. In some, it appears after the food is digested, while in others it persists almost 24 hours a day. Taking medicines gives temporary relief — like pouring water over boiling milk — but the problem keeps returning.
</div><div>
Many people assume that spicy and sour foods are the main culprits and stop them completely. This is a mistake. These two are not the real culprits. Unless the true causes are identified and corrected, simply avoiding spicy or sour foods will not make the burning sensation go away, nor will it prevent future episodes.
</div><div>
When the burning is intense, people often consume sugar water, milk, cold drinks, biscuits, and similar items. These may reduce the burning for about half an hour, but afterward the problem returns with double intensity. In fact, these increase acidity. Such foods are called acidic foods. The goal should be to prevent excess acid production in the stomach, not to keep neutralizing it temporarily.
</div><div>
<b>Common Mistakes That Cause Burning Sensation:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drinking too little water reduces the protective mucus secretion in the stomach and intestines, leading to burning.
</li><li>
People who consume tea and coffee produce more acid, while the protective mucus that guards against acid is reduced by nearly half.
</li><li>
Drinking water while eating dilutes stomach acid and interferes with proper digestion. To compensate, the stomach produces more acid, and when this diluted acid suddenly becomes concentrated, severe burning occurs.
</li><li>
Painkillers damage and strip away the protective mucus lining.
</li><li>
Anger, irritation, stress, and tension increase acid production and reduce mucus secretion, resulting in burning.
</li><li>
Fatty foods such as meat, eggs, oil, ghee, and rich rice dishes like pulao stimulate acid production even when the stomach is empty, gradually damaging the stomach.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
With so many causes at work, what benefit is there in avoiding only spices and sour foods? No matter how much money is spent, the problem remains.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink about 5 liters of water daily, preferably lukewarm. Lukewarm water works as an antidote to acidity.
</li><li>
Whenever the burning sensation is severe, mix 3–4 teaspoons of honey in lukewarm water and drink it. It provides immediate relief.
</li><li>
Completely avoid tea and coffee.
</li><li>
It is best to stop acidity medicines and begin these practices. During the first 1–2 days, medicines may be used only in emergencies if absolutely necessary.
</li><li>
Avoid eating frequently and continuously. Eat only three meals a day — morning, afternoon, and evening. Eat fully at each meal and then stop. This prevents acid secretion on an empty stomach. Eating small amounts frequently keeps the stomach constantly working, so acid production never stops.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
Just as you would feel irritated if guests kept arriving at your home every hour without warning, the stomach too has been under constant strain all these years. Understand this, treat your stomach with care, and it will keep you comfortable. Within 2–3 days, the burning sensation will reduce significantly and you will feel relief.
</div>

<h1>17. How to Get Rid of Amoebiasis and Intestinal Worms
<a name="chapter17"></a></h1>
<div>
Some people blame a change of water or a change of place for these problems, but they never look at themselves as the cause. As long as the mistake lies within us, amoebiasis will not go away — even if we drink boiled water. Animals drink whatever water is available, even greenish or muddy water, yet they do not suffer from amoebiasis or intestinal worms. This is because their intestines have strong protective and killing power against such organisms. We seem to have everything except this strength.
</div><div>
This problem occurs more often in people who suffer from constipation. When stool remains retained in the intestines, many types of harmful organisms multiply and damage intestinal health. As these harmful microbes increase, the beneficial bacteria in the intestines decrease. When protective microorganisms are reduced, amoebae stick to the intestinal walls and begin to multiply.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
For 2–3 days, take an enema with lukewarm water every morning.
</li><li>
On the following day, squeeze the juice of one large lemon (without seeds or pulp) into lukewarm water and take an enema with this solution.
</li><li>
Using only one container of enema water is not enough. To properly clean the intestinal walls, after finishing one container, try to take a second container immediately.
</li><li>
From the fourth day, prepare neem-leaf water for the enema: Take a handful of neem leaves, boil them in 2 liters of water, allow it to cool, strain it, and use this greenish water for the enema. Doing neem-water enemas daily for 3–4 days helps detach amoebiasis organisms and intestinal worms stuck to the intestinal walls, forcing them out due to the bitterness.
</li><li>
After using neem-water enemas for 4 days, continue with plain lukewarm-water enemas for another 2–3 days, then stop.
</li><li>
To help beneficial protective microorganisms grow quickly in the intestines, eat only curd rice for breakfast. (It is better if the rice is made from raw rice cooked the previous night, mixed with milk and allowed to ferment. You may add chopped onion and green chili.)
This helps increase beneficial bacteria in the intestines.
</li><li>
At lunch and dinner, follow food rules carefully to prevent constipation.
</li><li>
If amoebiasis still seems to persist, after 20–25 days, repeat the neem-water enema for 4–5 consecutive days, then stop.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
Following this method carefully helps restore intestinal health and eliminates amoebiasis and intestinal worms naturally.
</div>

<h1>18. How to Heal Wounds Faster
<a name="chapter18"></a></h1>
<div>
In some people, even when boils appear, cuts occur, or injuries happen, healing takes a long time. Those with low immunity and those who are deficient in vitamin C tend to heal more slowly.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink sour fruit juices mixed with honey.
</li><li>
While eating meals, squeeze the juice of one or two lemons and consume it little by little along with the food. This can be done twice a day and need not be stopped permanently.
</li><li>
Guavas are inexpensive and easily available. If everyone eats one or two guavas daily, it is very beneficial. Those who have difficulty chewing can eat ripe guava fruit pulp instead.
</li>
</ol>
<div>

</div>
<h1>19. How to Relieve Neck Pain
<a name="chapter19"></a></h1>
<div>
Neck pain commonly affects those who constantly keep the neck bent forward, those who use a high pillow while sleeping, people who ride motorcycles for long hours in a hunched posture, those who do not exercise at all, and women who, even at home, sit for long periods bending the waist and neck forward. Because the neck remains bent forward for long durations, the cervical vertebrae put pressure on the discs between them. This pressure leads to neck pain.
</div><div>
At times, the nerves that run from the neck into the arms get compressed, resulting in symptoms such as pain radiating into the arms, numbness, tingling, loss of grip in the fingers, or a pulling sensation in the nerves of the arms. Although the pain appears in the arms, the root cause lies in the neck. In some people, neck pain can also cause dizziness, headaches, and in severe cases, even fainting.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
First, remove the pillow from under the head.
</li><li>
Wherever and whenever you sit, maintain the neck in a straight, aligned position.
</li><li>
Apply coconut oil to the neck area and place a hot-water bag over it for 10–15 minutes, twice a day.
</li><li>
Avoid postures that bend the neck forward. Even Surya Namaskars should be avoided.
</li><li>
Practice only backward-bending postures such as Matsyasana, Ushtrasana, and Bhujangasana.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
If these practices are followed for 20–25 days, neck pain reduces significantly. Those who do not currently have neck pain can prevent it altogether by following these precautions from the beginning.
</div>

<h1>20. How to Reduce Pimples (Acne)
<a name="chapter20"></a></h1>
<div>
Pimples form when sebum, the oily substance secreted by the sweat glands in the skin, reacts chemically with bacteria that accumulate on the skin surface. As a result, the hair follicles become affected by a kind of infection. The sebaceous ducts that produce sebum get blocked, and this leads to the formation of hard eruptions from within, often with black or white tips. These are what we commonly call pimples.
</div><div>
People who suffer from severe constipation tend to accumulate more waste matter in the body, which in turn collects in the skin and worsens acne. Those who drink very little water are also more prone to pimples, as the skin does not get cleaned properly from within.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Do not scratch, squeeze, or press pimples. Doing so can leave scars or permanent pits on the skin.
</li><li>
Stop using heavy topical creams or medicines on the face. Avoid soaps as well, and instead gently rub the face with gram flour (besan) or a soft cloth.
</li><li>
Take black soil, dry it well, grind it into a fine powder, and remove any coarse particles. Dry the cleaned soil in sunlight for 2–3 days. Then soak a small quantity of this soil in water for 1–2 days and use the cooled mud for application.
</li><li>
Mix a little lemon juice and a very small amount of coconut oil, apply it to the face, and massage gently. After this, apply a thick layer of the prepared cool mud on the face, especially on the pimple-affected areas. Leave it on for 20–25 minutes and then wash it off. The massage and mud application help remove accumulated waste from the skin pores. Doing this once daily, preferably on an empty stomach, gives good results.
</li><li>
It is better to avoid using face powders. Even people with dark or dull skin can regain a healthy glow by applying this mud regularly. The skin gradually becomes clear and radiant. However, avoid moving around the house or sitting in front of the television with mud on your face — children may get scared, and you might even end up with a fever from the shock!
</li><li>
Drink 4–5 liters of good water daily.
</li><li>
Drinking carrot juice in the morning and fruit juices in the evening helps pimples heal faster, improves complexion, and clears impurities from the blood.
</li><li>
Ensure that bowel movements are smooth and regular.
</li>
</ol>
<h1>21. How to Avoid Travel Fatigue
<a name="chapter21"></a></h1>
<div>
Travel itself is meant to be enjoyable. When you add more fun to it — carrying snacks, chatting, observing people coming and going, and looking around — you hardly feel that you are traveling at all. Before you realize it, you feel like you have already reached your destination.
</div><div>
But many people avoid drinking water during travel, fearing that it will make them want to urinate, and instead keep eating continuously. By the time they reach home, their face looks sunken, the eyes appear hollow, the skin turns dull and dark, and the body feels exhausted. Then they complain, “The weather didn’t suit me,” “The bus or car ride affected me,” or “I had to urinate on the train, and since then I’ve had an infection and burning during urination.”
</div><div>
Without realizing their own mistakes, they blame everything else.
</div><div>
During bus, train, or car journeys, air rushes toward the body at high speed through windows and vents. Because of this airflow, the water inside the body evaporates more rapidly — just like how the floor dries quickly under a fan. Roughly half a glass of water is lost every hour. On top of that, people do not drink water at all, and instead eat foods that further increase the body’s water requirement. Due to continuous evaporation and lack of intake, the body’s water level drops. This leads to headaches, body aches, a feeling of internal heat, dryness of the throat, and frequent throat infections.
</div><div>
If you want to avoid these problems during long journeys:
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Always start your journey with a water bottle by your side. Once your stomach feels slightly empty, drink half a glass to three-fourths of a glass of water every 40–50 minutes. If you drink water this way, you will not feel the urge to urinate frequently. The water gets properly utilized inside the body, meeting its needs, and you remain comfortable throughout the journey.
</li><li>
Make it a habit to consume more fruits while traveling.
</li><li>
There is no harm in eating snacks occasionally, but constantly munching on them can cause problems. Nothing protects you during travel the way water does — so drink it carefully and regularly.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>22. How to Heal Broken Bones Faster
<a name="chapter22"></a></h1>
<div>
When a bone breaks, people commonly advise eating plenty of meat, eggs, keema, and bone soup, believing that these help the bone join faster and build muscle quickly. When someone in the house is confined to bed, family members — especially women — keep cooking different rich dishes and serving them continuously.
</div><div>
But when a person lies idle and eats all this heavy food, most of the body’s energy gets constantly diverted to the digestive system just to process that food. Very little energy is left for repairing and joining the broken bone. As a result, bone healing becomes slow, swelling remains at the fracture site, body weight increases by 10–15 kilos, and complete healing can take more than 3–4 months.
</div><div>
Animals, on the other hand, behave very differently. When they suffer a fracture, they often remain almost fasting for 8–10 days, using all their internal energy solely for healing. That is why their bones join much faster.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Completely avoid meat and eggs. Instead, eat sprouted seeds and sufficient raw coconut as a morning breakfast. Along with this, consume one ball of sesame seeds (sesame laddu or a small handful).
</li><li>
At lunchtime, eat rotis and vegetables in moderation, ensuring that body weight does not increase.
</li><li>
In the evening, take fruit juices and fruits, and stop eating by 6 o’clock. Avoid eating anything at night. During this time, the body actively focuses on repairing and joining the bones.
</li><li>
Chewing 1–2 betel leaves daily after meals is beneficial, as they contain a good amount of calcium.
</li>
</ol>
<h1>23. How to Reduce Headaches
<a name="chapter23"></a></h1>
<div>
Many people suffer from frequent headaches. Most simply take a painkiller to suppress the pain, without addressing the real underlying causes. That is why, even after many years, the headache does not truly go away. There are 10–12 possible causes for headaches, and not everyone gets them for the same reason. In some people, multiple causes together may lead to headaches.
</div><div>
Common causes include excessive consumption of tea and coffee, drinking too little water, constipation, severe gas trouble, poor digestion, persistent nasal congestion or runny nose, neck pain, low blood levels (anemia), narrowing of blood vessels in the head, poor eyesight, and similar factors. If treatment focuses on removing these root causes, headaches can be completely eliminated.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink at least 5 liters of good-quality water every day without fail.
</li><li>
Ensure smooth bowel movements 2–3 times daily.
</li><li>
Take a cold-water head bath every day. Even if the headache increases slightly for the first 2–3 days, it will reduce once the body adjusts. Head baths improve blood circulation to the head and reduce excess heat.
</li><li>
Completely avoid tea and coffee in the morning. Instead, drink honey water, green vegetable juice, or fruit juice.
</li><li>
For breakfast, eat only sprouts or fruits. This helps improve digestion.
</li><li>
When a headache occurs, place both feet in hot water and sit for about 15 minutes with a wet cloth placed on the head (especially over the crown). Relief usually comes quickly.
</li><li>
If the headache is still unbearable despite following these steps, you may take medicine as before. Within 8–10 days, the need for medication will gradually disappear on its own.
</li>
</ol>
<h1>24. How to Prevent Skin Dryness and Whitening in Winter
<a name="chapter24"></a></h1>
<div>
During winter, many people notice their skin turning pale or looking as if excessive powder has been applied, and they start using cold creams. To prevent the skin from becoming like this or from cracking during winter, soaps should be avoided. In winter, the skin is already naturally dry. Using soap makes it even drier and rougher. The chemicals present in soaps damage the outer layer of the skin. When the old layer gets damaged and a new layer does not form properly, the skin becomes pale, cracked, and unhealthy.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Completely stop using soaps. Before bathing, apply a little coconut oil all over the body. Take a soft towel and go to the bathroom.
</li><li>
After wetting the body with water, wet the towel, squeeze out the excess water, and gently rub the entire body with it. All the dirt will come off onto the towel without damaging the skin.
</li><li>
After rubbing, rinse again with water and wipe the body with a dry towel. That is sufficient.
</li><li>
If this type of bath is followed every day, the skin remains thoroughly clean and develops a healthy, natural glow.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>25. How to Reduce Skin Fungal Patches (Shobhi)
<a name="chapter25"></a></h1>
<div>
Shobhi occurs in two forms — black patches and white patches — and both spoil the appearance of the skin. It mainly develops in areas where sweat accumulates and remains for long periods. Due to this sweat, fungal organisms settle in those areas, cause infection, and the skin develops patchy discoloration. This problem is more common in people who do not bathe properly.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Grind tender neem leaves into a paste and rub it over the affected areas, then take a bath.
</li><li>
Occasionally, mix honey and lemon juice and apply it to the skin, allow it to absorb well, and then bathe. Alternatively, applying plain lemon juice alone is also beneficial.
</li><li>
Bathing as mentioned above cleanses the skin thoroughly and prevents germs from settling. If done regularly, the condition reduces within 20–25 days.
</li><li>
Drinking more natural juices as part of the diet is also good for skin health.
</li>
</ol>
<h1>26. How to Reduce Hair Fall
<a name="chapter26"></a></h1>
<div>
Some people who have everything in life still do not have good hair, while beggars who have nothing else may have plenty of hair. In earlier generations, people had thick, dense, and long hair. Our present-day habits are the main reason for hair fall.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Take a head bath every day using cool or normal water. This helps strengthen the hair roots. Pouring hot water on the head frequently damages the hair roots due to heat and causes excessive hair fall.
</li><li>
Stop using shampoos and wash your hair for 7–8 days with soapnut (shikakai) water. Commercial hair products available in shops damage the hair and make it brittle.
</li><li>
After the hair dries, apply coconut oil. This protects the hair and roots from damage caused by sunlight and dryness.
</li><li>
Losing about 100 hairs a day and regrowing 100 hairs is a sign of good health. In many people, hair falls but does not regrow. To promote regrowth, cook and eat plenty of leafy vegetables during lunch.
</li><li>
Protein-rich foods are essential for hair growth and strength. Therefore, make it a habit to eat sprouted seeds every morning. Along with sprouts, regularly consume coconut and peanuts for better results.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>27. How to Reduce Burning Sensation While Urinating
<a name="chapter27"></a></h1>
<div>
This problem occurs more commonly in women due to drinking insufficient water. When urine is concentrated or yellow in color, and when it is held in for many hours, the increased concentration causes a burning sensation while passing urine. Urine should always appear clear to the eye and flow in a steady stream whenever passed. It should never be thick or have a foul smell.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink 4–5 liters of water every day. Within 2–3 days, the burning sensation during urination will reduce.
</li><li>
Even during the daytime, water must be consumed at regular intervals. Those who move around in the sun should drink even more water to prevent burning.
</li><li>
Drinking sugar water or other beverages to reduce burning is useless and does not help.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>28. How to Reduce Leg Numbness and Burning Sensation
<a name="chapter28"></a></h1>
<div>
This problem is commonly seen in people who are overweight, those with diabetes, those who have low hemoglobin, or those whose blood vessels are partially blocked. The primary cause is poor blood circulation. In addition, deficiency of B-vitamins — especially Vitamin B1 — can lead to burning sensations in the legs, numbness, and swelling of the feet.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Take two basins. Fill one with hot water and the other with cold water. Sit on a chair and first place your feet in the hot water for 5 minutes, then transfer them to the cold water for 2 minutes. Again place the feet in hot water for 5 minutes, followed by cold water for 2 minutes.
When the feet are placed in hot water, blood flow increases; when shifted to cold water, circulation is stimulated again. This repeated movement of blood upward and downward improves overall blood circulation in the legs.
</li><li>
Eating unpolished rice (raw rice) helps correct Vitamin B deficiencies naturally. With this, burning sensations and numbness gradually subside.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>29. How to Reduce Scalp (Crown) Pain
<a name="chapter29"></a></h1>
<div>
Headache and scalp (crown) pain are different. This pain occurs only at the crown of the head. It is commonly experienced during bus travel, shopping, walking in the sun, or during periods of stress. People who drink very little water often suffer from this problem — due to insufficient water in the body, proper blood circulation does not reach the head, the water content in the blood reduces, and the crown area overheats, leading to scalp pain.
</div><div>
Just as an engine overheats when the radiator runs low on water, the crown of the head overheats when the body lacks water. In the situations mentioned above, avoiding water intake for fear of needing to urinate leads directly to scalp pain.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Whenever you feel crown pain, immediately wet the crown of your head with water. If possible, place a damp cloth on the crown.
</li><li>
If scalp pain occurs during the daytime, it is good to take a head bath in the evening.
</li><li>
Drink plenty of water every day. Keep a water bottle with you and sip small amounts frequently during the situations mentioned above. This will not cause frequent urination, and scalp pain will be prevented.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>30. How to Lose Weight
<a name="chapter30"></a></h1>
<div>
Most people try to lose weight by cutting down food, become weak and exhausted, yet do not actually lose weight. To reduce weight properly, junk food must be completely avoided and good, wholesome food should be increased. When this is done, weight reduces and health also improves.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Overweight people usually have low blood levels. Drinking a glass of green vegetable juice helps improve blood quality without increasing weight.
</li><li>
For breakfast, instead of eating 1–2 idlis or dosas, it is better to eat a generous quantity of sprouted grains. This removes nutritional deficiencies and reduces fatigue. Except for coconut and groundnuts, other sprouts can be eaten.
</li><li>
For lunch, completely avoid rice. Eat 3–4 rotis along with plenty of vegetables (plain — without salt or oil). The more vegetables you eat, the more fat melts away. Because vegetables contain fiber, they help burn fat without increasing weight. After rotis, a small quantity of curd may be taken. Avoid rice altogether.
</li><li>
In the evening around 5 o’clock, drink one glass of fruit juice. It improves blood quality and is good for health. Fruits do not cause weight gain.
</li><li>
Finish dinner by 6–6:30 pm. Eating late at night converts food into fat. Eating early helps burn stored fat.
</li><li>
For dinner, manage with 2–3 rotis and plenty of vegetables. Avoid curd and rice.
</li><li>
To lose weight, practicing yoga asanas daily is helpful. For areas where fat accumulates more, there are specific asanas that help melt fat in those regions.
</li><li>
If you read and practice the asanas I have written about for weight loss, you can lose 5–6 kilograms per month. Following these asanas along with the food rules mentioned above gives very good results.
</li>
</ol>

Our elders hardly knew a problem called dandruff. Nowadays, there is hardly anyone who has not heard of dandruff. Naturally, the skin releases a greasy, oil-like substance to protect itself from the environment. This keeps the skin soft and supple. On the scalp, when this greasy secretion does not get proper air exposure, it hardens, dries up, and sheds in flakes.
</div><div>
Many people bathe daily only up to the body and neglect the head, as if the head does not belong to them. Because of this, the scalp does not get cleaned properly and dandruff develops. Those who frequently use shampoos also face this problem — the chemicals in shampoos damage the outer layer of the skin and cause excessive flaking. On the day you use shampoo, the scalp may feel fine, but from the next day onward, the damage begins to show. We get misled by advertisements claiming “anti-dandruff shampoo.” How much money is being wasted on medicines to treat a problem that actually arises simply from not washing the head properly. No medicines are needed for this.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Wash your head daily with cool water. Do not pour hot water on the head. If the water is too cold, mix a little warm water so it is mildly cool — like well water.
</li><li>
Once a week, or once every ten days, wash your head with soapnut (reetha / shikakai-like) juice. If dandruff is severe, apply the juice well on a dry scalp, leave it for 5–10 minutes, and then wash with cool water. Those with severe dandruff may use soapnut juice daily for 7–8 days.
</li><li>
After the hair dries, apply coconut oil. Many people think applying oil increases dandruff. This is not true for those who wash their head daily. Just as applying coconut oil helps when the skin becomes dry and flaky in winter, oil can also be applied for dandruff. Our elders did not have dandruff because they regularly applied oil.
</li><li>
If the scalp feels excessively oily, applying the juice of one lemon to the scalp and then washing the head daily helps remove excess oil. Lemon juice is very effective in cleaning the extra oily secretions released by the scalp’s sebaceous glands.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>32. How to Relieve Calf Muscle Pain
<a name="chapter32"></a></h1>
<div>
Calf pain most commonly occurs due to weakness. People who do a lot of physical work without eating properly first experience strain in the calf muscles when fatigue sets in. Those who walk excessively may also develop calf pain because the muscles are unable to tolerate the strain. Calf cramps can also occur when the body is deficient in salts such as sodium and magnesium. In those who completely stop consuming salt, calf cramps may occur during the first week or ten days and then gradually subside. The solution is simple — eat nourishing food that enables the body to withstand the work it performs.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Avoid polished white rice and instead cook and eat unpolished (raw) rice twice daily in adequate quantity. Within 15–20 days, calf pain reduces. Calf pain caused by excessive physical work improves significantly with unpolished rice.
</li><li>
Every day at lunch, include leafy vegetables — especially spinach and similar greens — and eat them generously. This helps correct mineral deficiencies.
</li><li>
If calves cramp frequently, or if pain occurs after extensive walking or travel, apply a little coconut oil to the calves, massage gently, and then apply a hot water compress for about ten minutes. This relieves fatigue and pain effectively.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>33. How to Reduce Nausea
<a name="chapter33"></a></h1>
<div>
Nausea mostly occurs due to disturbances in digestion. It can happen when there is excess mucus in the intestines immediately after waking up, when food is not digested properly, when one travels by bus or car soon after eating, or when the food consumed contains unsuitable or toxic substances. When nausea occurs, one often feels that vomiting would bring relief. During this time, dizziness may also occur and the body feels unsettled. It feels like vomiting will happen, but it doesn’t. Although everyone feels that vomiting would help, the urge to induce it does not come easily. Unless the nausea becomes severe, vomiting does not occur — and without vomiting, the discomfort does not subside.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
If possible, drink lukewarm water; otherwise, drink 5–6 glasses of normal water continuously (without adding salt). If you can drink more, continue drinking. As you keep drinking water, the nausea should intensify. Drink in such a way that vomiting occurs while drinking. If you are unable to drink further, stop and induce vomiting by placing fingers in the mouth. The water you drank will go inside, collect the toxins present, and bring them out.
</li><li>
Even if there is food in the stomach, you may do this whenever nausea occurs.
</li><li>
After vomiting, do not eat anything immediately. Rest for a while, and then drink honey with lemon juice or coconut water — you will feel much better.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>34. How to Reduce Sneezing
<a name="chapter34"></a></h1>
<div>
Sneezing itself is actually good for health, but sneezing 50–60 times a day is a sign of illness. Excess mucus accumulates in the nose and in the nasal side cavities (sinuses), creating a major obstruction to the flow of air. To loosen this mucus and allow it to drain out, so that airflow becomes smooth again, the body induces sneezing and tries to expel the mucus. While the body is trying to remove this impurity for our benefit, we, lacking patience or time, take medicines to suppress sneezing. As a result, sneezing stops temporarily, but the mucus continues to accumulate, leading to various infections. Eventually, sneezing becomes a lifelong problem, and dependence on medicines never ends.
</div><div>
For some people, sneezing occurs when exposed to cold; for others, it happens due to dust. In some cases, incense smoke, strong odors, or other triggers cause sneezing in different ways. This condition can be completely eliminated within 20–30 days.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
This problem is more common in people who drink less water. Therefore, drink about five liters of water daily, making it lukewarm. Cold water is of no help.
</li><li>
In the morning, do brisk walking or jogging (light running that does not cause exhaustion), depending on what suits your age, for 40–50 minutes. While doing this, do not talk; keep your mind focused on your breath and take deep breaths. Move your arms actively. This helps the mucus evaporate and clear out.
</li><li>
Practice deep-breathing pranayama (not the slow, gentle types of breathing). Begin only after the nasal passages are free of mucus. If there is some mucus, first do the exercises mentioned above for a few days. If you wish, you may also practice pranayama by reading the pranayama book I have written.
</li><li>
Every day, apply a little oil to the face and take steam inhalation for about 10 minutes. If desired, steam inhalation can be done twice a day. There is no need to add anything to the water.
</li><li>
Avoid sugar, sweets, refrigerated foods, and cold drinks.
</li><li>
For 70–80 percent of people, these tips alone are sufficient. If, for some, the problem does not fully subside, then it will not go away completely unless the diet is followed strictly without salt, as we have explained.
</li><li>
Completely stop all medicines taken for sneezing.
</li>
</ol> 

<h1>35. How to Prevent Sun Allergy
<a name="chapter35"></a></h1>
<div>
While the sun gives life to everything, for humans it seems to cause allergies instead of health. In some people, the skin on areas exposed to the sun becomes dark, rough, and burnt-looking, while the parts covered by clothing remain normal. Such people only try to avoid going into the sun, but do not attempt to correct the underlying mistake. Everyone who drinks less water tends to develop sun allergy. Especially in women, this problem is more common simply because they do not drink enough water.
</div><div>
When a tree does not get sufficient water, its leaves cannot withstand the sun and get scorched. What happens in our body is exactly the same. To withstand the heat of the sun, the water present in the skin evaporates and cools the skin. If the body does not have enough water, the skin cannot protect itself from the heat and gets burnt. As long as there is oil in a lamp, the flame does not burn the wick; similarly, as long as there is sufficient water in our body, no matter how strong the sun is, it cannot harm our skin.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink at least five liters of good water every day.
</li></li>
Before going out into the sun each day, make sure you have consumed enough water. Even if you walk or work in the sun, drink water in such a way that your urine remains clear and flows freely.
</li></li>
It takes about five to six months for darkened skin to return to its normal color.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>36. How to Reduce Gas Trouble
<a name="chapter36"></a></h1>
<div>
This is one of the problems troubling the largest population in the world. Producing about one liter of gas in the intestines every day is a sign of good health. Even if more gas is produced, as long as it passes out freely, it should not be called a problem. When the gas that is produced does not come out freely — either from below or from above — and gets trapped, it is called gas trouble. In some people, the gas gets so severe that they feel as if they are having heart pain. Gas formation occurs in everyone, without any difference between men and women. The only difference is that some people release it with sound, while others release it silently — but for everyone, passing gas is normal.
</div><div>
There are five main causes of gas trouble.
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Constipation:</b> Because of constipation, excessive gas is produced in the intestines. Stagnant stool produces gas just like manure produces biogas in a pit. Since the intestines are clogged with stool and there is no passage for the gas to escape, the gas gets trapped, causing tightness or pain below the navel.
</li><li>
<b>Drinking water while eating:</b> Drinking water during meals slows down digestion, causing food to ferment and produce more gas.
</li><li>
<b>Not chewing food properly:</b> Those who swallow food without chewing properly experience poor digestion, which leads to gas formation.
</li><li>
<b>Eating foods that digest slowly: </b> Foods rich in fats and heavy items — such as meat, pulao, eggs, and processed foods — stay in the intestines for a long time (about 6–7 hours) for digestion, resulting in excessive gas production.
</li><li>
<b>Protein-rich foods:</b> Protein-rich foods naturally produce some gas. For example, leafy vegetables, seeds, toor dal, and green gram. Gas produced due to reasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 may come out upward as belching, or get trapped in the abdomen or chest.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Ensure smooth bowel movements 2–3 times a day. Even after drinking water, if stools are not smooth, do enemas daily for 7–8 days in a row to clean the intestines.
</li><li>
Do not drink water while eating. Drink water half an hour before meals and two hours after eating.
</li><li>
Chew food thoroughly, grind it well with the teeth, and eat slowly.
</li><li>
Avoid oily foods, fatty foods, meat, and pulao. Eat foods that are light and digest quickly.
</li><li>
Completely avoid leafy vegetables, toor dal, green gram, broad beans, and sprouted seeds for 10–15 days.
</li><li>
In the morning, instead of regular breakfast items, eat only fruits and dates (people with diabetes should avoid dates).
</li><li>
Using lemon juice and green chilies is fine.
</li><li>
Finish dinner early in the evening and stop eating by dusk.
</li> 
</ol>

<h1>37. How to Reduce Sciatic Pain (Leg Nerve Pain)
<a name="chapter37"></a></h1>
<div>
This condition is commonly known as sciatic pain. From the spine, a large nerve passes through the hip, runs along the back of the thigh, goes through the calf, and reaches all the way down to the foot. This sciatic nerve exists in both legs. When this nerve gets compressed between the vertebrae in the lower back, it causes sensations such as tingling in the leg, pulling of the nerve, numbness, cramping, and stiffness. The pain is usually felt along the back side of the leg.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Avoid sitting on the floor and stop doing activities that involve bending forward.
</li><li>
Whenever you lie down, and whenever you are resting, place a thick pillow under your knees and lie flat on your back. This gives relief by reducing pressure on the nerve — similar to how a crushed wire feels less strained when pressure is relieved.
</li><li>
Practicing the yoga posture called Shalabhasana (Locust Pose) gives very good relief. For the first 8–10 days, practice it lightly once a day. After getting accustomed, if possible, practice it for a longer duration twice a day.
</li><li>
Wherever you sit, keep your lower back straight and upright.
</li><li>
As much as possible, stay rested and avoid strain — this helps the condition improve faster.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>38. How to Reduce Tonsil Swelling
<a name="chapter38"></a></h1>
<div>
In the throat, on either side, tonsils (adenoids) stand guard—much like security personnel stationed on both sides of a minister’s doorway. If any germs, bacteria, toxins, or poisonous substances enter our body through food or water, the tonsils try to block them from going further inside and protect the body. When harmful bacteria are present in what we eat or drink, the tonsils stop them, and as a result they themselves get infected—leading to swelling, pain, narrowing of the throat, and difficulty in swallowing. When this infection occurs frequently, unable to bear the discomfort, many people opt for surgery to remove the tonsils completely. Just as removing guards causes harm to a house, removing tonsils leads to more problems for the body. This condition is commonly seen in children who consume a lot of cold items such as sweets, ice creams, cool drinks, chocolates, and similar foods.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
The water you drink throughout the day should be boiled, cooled, and then reheated to a lukewarm temperature before drinking. Drinking plenty of such water helps the infection subside quickly.
</li><li>
Chewing neem twigs and spitting out the bitter juice helps reduce infection due to its bitterness.
</li><li>
Applying a little oil on the outer throat area and giving a hot-water fomentation twice a day helps reduce pain.
</li><li>
If the infection is severe, observing a complete fast for 2–3 days with only honey water gives very good relief.
</li><li>
Until the infection subsides completely, avoid eating anything till afternoon. From morning, drink honey water and plain water 2–3 times.
</li><li>
At lunch, eat light, bland vegetable preparations.
</li><li>
In the evening, avoid cooked food and finish eating sufficient fruits by 5 or 6 o’clock. If hunger arises at night, you may drink honey water and go to sleep.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
If followed as above for 6–7 days, the swelling and infection subside completely without the need for any medicines.
</div>
<h1>39. How to Build Healthy Blood (Increase Hemoglobin)
<a name="chapter39"></a></h1>
<div>
Every day, several crores of red blood cells in our body naturally die. If the number of red blood cells becomes low, or if hemoglobin—the substance that gives blood its red color—becomes low, the condition is called anemia. People with anemia often experience weakness, palpitations, shortness of breath, and a pale appearance of the face. In our country, anemia is seen more commonly in women than in men. This is because women lose some blood every month through menstruation. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers also require more blood. Generally, women do not pay as much attention to their own food intake as they do to feeding others, and that is why this problem is more common among them.
</div><div>
Anemia is most often caused by a deficiency of iron. Hemoglobin is formed only with the help of iron. For the body to absorb iron properly, vitamin C is also required. Therefore, if we regularly take both iron and vitamin C through food, the body can build good-quality blood. Instead of buying iron tablets from the market, naturally obtained iron through food is far more beneficial to the body. Since crores of red blood cells die every day, good food is essential for new ones to be formed in their place.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Take carrots, native tomatoes, cucumber, ridge gourd, and beetroot together, extract the juice, strain it, and take one large glass of this juice. Add 3–4 teaspoons of honey and squeeze lemon juice into it. Drink this in the morning around 7 or 8 o’clock.
</li><li>
The vitamin C in lemon juice helps the iron in the juice to be well absorbed from the intestines.
</li><li>
In the evening around 4 or 5 o’clock, take one glass of sour fruit juice and add 3–4 spoons of honey to it before drinking.
</li><li>
Honey helps build blood faster than most other foods. If the honey is genuine, the benefits can be seen clearly within 10–15 days. Honey can be used generously as suggested above.
</li><li>
Dates are rich in iron. Eating 10–15 dates daily helps improve blood levels quickly.
</li><li>
Leafy vegetables should be eaten almost every day. Those who can maintain these habits daily will gain even greater benefits.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>40. How to Get Rid of Soreness and Infection Between the Toes (Inter-toe Fungal Infection)
<a name="chapter40"></a></h1>
<div>
This problem is commonly seen in people who stay in water for long periods and in those whose toes are very close together without enough space between them. Moisture gets trapped in the gaps between the toes, allowing fungus to grow. This leads to infection, bad odor, irritation, and discomfort.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
After finishing work or returning from wet conditions, completely dry the spaces between the toes using cotton or a soft cloth.
</li><li>
Apply dry turmeric powder in the gaps between the toes. Doing this twice a day helps the problem subside quickly.
</li><li>
Those who have to walk or work in wet conditions frequently should apply coconut oil between the toes before going into water. Applying oil prevents moisture from staying trapped in those spaces.
</li><li>
People whose toes are very close together and lack proper air circulation can place a small piece of cotton between two toes. This creates space, allows air to circulate, and prevents odor, soreness, and infection.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>41. How to Reduce Pain During Menstruation
<a name="chapter41"></a></h1>
<div>
This is a common problem that women frequently face during menstruation. In many cases, pain starts in the lower back and lower abdomen 2–3 days before the periods. If the pain reduces once the bleeding begins and flows smoothly, it usually indicates the presence of an infection related to the uterus.
</div><div>
In some women, severe pain starts on one side of the lower back (waist/hip area) and spreads upward toward the lower abdomen. Such women generally also suffer from constipation, abdominal bloating, and gas-related problems. During menstruation, the uterus becomes very sensitive. Pressure from problems in the intestines can aggravate the uterus, causing pain.
</div><div>
In some cases, pain may be due to fibroids in the uterus or ovaries. In a few women, the pain may be accompanied by dizziness or even fainting.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Whenever possible, do enemas daily for 7–8 days to thoroughly clean the intestines. After that, ensure that bowel movements occur smoothly 2–3 times a day.
</li><li>
When pain is present during that time, apply a little oil to the lower abdomen and place a hot-water compress over it for 5–6 minutes. Then place a cool, damp cloth (cool like water stored in a pot) on the same area for 2–3 minutes. Repeat by alternating the hot compress and the cool cloth.
</li><li>
Drink plenty of water throughout the day. In the evening, eat only fruits and stop eating early. This helps reduce infection-related issues.
</li><li>
If the problem does not completely subside even after 2–3 months and remains very troublesome, it is advisable to consult a doctor. When the pain is unbearable, pain-relief tablets may be used.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>42. How to Reduce Urination at Night
<a name="chapter42"></a></h1>
<div>
As age increases, many people have to wake up at night to urinate 2–3 times, and some even 5–6 times. This disturbs sleep significantly. Some people drink a lot of water along with dinner and go to bed. Others believe that drinking water before sleeping is good for health and make it a habit. Cold weather and air conditioners also increase urine production. Apart from these, in men, enlargement of the prostate gland with age can also cause frequent urination at night.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>For people above 60 years of age:
<ul>
<li>In summer, it is better to stop drinking water by 5 p.m.</li>
<li>In the rainy or winter season, stop drinking water by 4 p.m.
This allows all the consumed water to be passed out as urine before bedtime.</li>
</ul>
</li><li>
Do not drink water with dinner or after dinner at night. If the mouth feels dry or there is thirst, you may take 2–3 small sips of water before going to bed.
</li><li>
Others can stop drinking water by 6–7 p.m. This is usually sufficient to prevent nighttime urination, even during winter.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>43. How to Reduce Nerve Cramps
<a name="chapter43"></a></h1>
<div>
At times, the fingers of the hands or the toes may suddenly stiffen, curl inward, and overlap one another. They may remain locked in that position for a while, causing intense pain. If this happens frequently to someone, it should be understood as a sign of significant calcium deficiency in the body.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Whenever available, or at least 2–3 times a week, eat betel leaves (1–2 leaves). Do not take them as paan with additives. They can be chewed plain, or smeared with a little honey before eating to prevent mouth irritation. Betel leaves are rich in calcium.
</li><li>
Eating 3–4 teaspoons of white sesame seeds daily is beneficial. If they are difficult to eat as they are, grind them with honey or dates and make small balls. Consuming one such ball daily helps the problem subside quickly.
</li><li>
Drinking finger millet (ragi) in sprouted form, or as a porridge made from ragi flour, is also helpful, as ragi is rich in calcium and helps prevent these issues.
</li><li>
Avoid calcium tablets and follow the above natural methods instead.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>44. How to Reduce Bleeding from the Gums
<a name="chapter44"></a></h1>
<div>
Many people experience swollen gums that appear puffed up over the teeth, as if they might burst and bleed when pressed. The teeth may feel loose, and the gums may bleed frequently — especially while brushing. This condition occurs purely due to a deficiency of Vitamin C. Those who eat only cooked food every day tend to develop this deficiency, because more than three-fourths of the Vitamin C present in food gets destroyed during cooking. Hence, it is important to include natural, uncooked foods daily.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Every day, drink one glass of orange juice, sweet lime juice, or musambi juice mixed with honey. Among these, orange juice is the most beneficial.
</li><li>
While eating meals, squeeze the juice of one lemon over the curries and eat. This can be done for both meals each day.
</li><li>
Whenever available, eat fresh Indian gooseberries (amla), either large or small. Large gooseberries can be sliced, sun-dried, stored, and 3–4 pieces can be chewed daily throughout the year. Pickled or preserved gooseberry pieces are not useful.
</li><li>
Guava is very rich in Vitamin C, so it is good to eat it every day.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>45. How to Reduce Mouth Ulcers
<a name="chapter45"></a></h1>
<div>
Small sores or ulcer-like patches often appear on the tongue and on the inner walls of the mouth. In some people, as soon as an ulcer heals in one place, another appears elsewhere — they seem to have mouth ulcers all the time. This problem commonly occurs in people who are under a lot of stress and in those who have certain intestinal disorders.
</div><div>
In some cases, instead of ulcers, people develop a coating in the mouth. The tongue and the inner side of the lips look reddish and coated, and cracks or sore patches appear at the corners of the mouth, as if they are chafed. A deficiency of Vitamin B in the body is the main reason for this condition.
</div><div>
Because most foods are polished and refined before consumption, the Vitamin B present in them gets removed along with the outer layers. This problem became more common after people started eating white rice regularly. During polishing, rice mills remove the first and second outer layers of the grain. These layers (bran) contain all types of Vitamin B. Once polished, white rice is left without them. The same happens with other grains and pulses such as toor dal, urad dal, and chickpeas. Even commonly used foods like Bombay rava, wheat rava, wheat flour, and refined flour (maida) are eaten without their outer layers, leading to this deficiency. Continuously swallowing Vitamin B-complex tablets for a lifetime is not a proper solution.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Every day, cook and eat unpolished raw rice as rice (without draining the water) for both meals. Those who prefer wheat can eat broken red wheat. Those who eat rotis should prepare them using stone-ground whole wheat flour.
</li><li>
Those who feel they cannot tolerate raw rice and feel nauseated even looking at it can simply eat 1–2 handfuls of rice bran daily. It can be obtained fresh from a mill once every 5–6 days.
</li><li>
An even easier method is to take a handful of rice bran, soak it in a large glass of water for 1–2 hours, then strain it and drink the water after adding honey and lemon juice. All the vitamins get released into the water. Drink this as a tonic — do not complain that someone asked you to drink bran water. After all, why go through all this trouble when eating raw rice itself can solve the problem easily?
</li>
</ol>

<h1>46. How to Improve Poor Appetite
<a name="chapter46"></a></h1>
<div>
Many people eat simply because it is time to eat, not because they actually feel hungry. Poor appetite is especially common in young children. The main cause of this condition is constipation. In anyone who has constipation, appetite is the first thing to reduce. When bowel movements are not smooth, the intestines remain filled with retained stool. Even though waste is not passing out properly, food intake from above continues. What goes out determines what should come in. When the intestinal environment becomes unhealthy, appetite slows down. Even without hunger, people eat thinking that not eating will cause weakness, and this only makes the problem worse.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
For 5–6 days, do an enema every morning to thoroughly clean the intestines.
</li><li>
In the morning, completely avoid milk, porridges, regular tiffins, sprouted grains, and similar foods. After drinking water, around 8 or 9 a.m., eat sufficient quantities of fruits such as papaya, chikoo (sapota), dates, and pomegranate as breakfast.
</li><li>
For lunch, eat food that digests easily. Prepare vegetables without spices — leafy greens, tubers, toor dal, and green gram — and eat them with chapatis, taking plenty of vegetables.
</li><li>
For dinner, eat fruits by 5 or 6 p.m. and stop eating thereafter. Keeping the stomach empty at night helps stimulate appetite. Once the problem reduces, ensure smooth bowel movements daily — this will prevent poor appetite from returning.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>47. How to Reduce Food Allergies
<a name="chapter47"></a></h1>
<div>
An allergy is essentially a conflict between what is good and what is bad. If both husband and wife are good, their life runs smoothly without conflicts. In the same way, if food on one side and the body on the other are both natural — that is, if the food is natural and the body is also in a natural state — there will be no conflict (allergy) between them. Even if both are bad, there is no conflict; they adjust to each other well. Problems arise only when one is good and the other is bad.
</div><div>
These days, people are developing allergies to honey, coconut, lemon, other sour foods, sunlight, cold, dust, vegetables, seeds — all of which are natural. If allergies are occurring to such things, it means unnatural substances have accumulated inside the body, producing allergy-causing factors. When the body has become internally unnatural, exposure to these natural things results in itching, rashes, swelling, throat irritation, and similar symptoms.
</div><div>
Since these things “do not suit” the body, people stop consuming them, thinking that avoiding them will solve the problem. But as internal imbalance keeps increasing, allergies gradually develop even to other natural foods. Has anyone ever gone to a doctor saying, “Meat doesn’t suit me,” or “Pickles don’t suit me,” or “Chocolates and biscuits don’t suit me”? These usually suit the body very well. Because the body has already become unhealthy, unhealthy foods merge with it easily — as if saying, “Come, come, we are friends.”
</div><div>
To get rid of allergies, avoiding natural foods is not the solution. The real solution is to wash away the root cause of allergy within the body and restore it to a natural state — then everything will start suiting you again.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
People who drink less water tend to develop more allergies. Therefore, make it a habit to drink 5 liters of water every day.
</li><li>
First, for 2–3 days, observe a fast with honey water. If lemon does not suit you, skip it and drink only honey mixed with water. During fasting, if needed, you may drink coconut water on the second or third day.
</li><li>
From the fourth day onward, consume only the fruits and fruit juices that suit you, 5–6 times a day, adding honey to them, and continue this for 3–4 days. Sugarcane juice may also be taken if it suits you.
</li><li>
From the next day, take juices around 8 a.m., fruits at 9–10 a.m., eat lunch with chapatis and bland vegetables (whatever suits you), and stop eating after having fruits at 5–6 p.m. If this is followed for 5–6 days, the body gets cleaned internally, the blood renews itself, and a degree of natural balance returns.
</li><li>
After 10–12 days, slowly reintroduce the foods that previously did not suit you, one by one. You may even wait another 10 days before trying. If someone still does not get relief, then avoiding food altogether — along with salt and oil — for a period will bring complete relief.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>48. How to Reduce Excess Body Heat
<a name="chapter48"></a></h1>
<div>
Some people say, “Whatever I eat causes heat in my body, so I don’t eat.” Heat is not a disease; it is a change occurring within the body. People often say honey causes heat, papaya causes heat, buttermilk causes heat, dates cause heat, mango causes heat, and so on. For such people, buttermilk, coconut water, sugar water, and gruels feel cooling. Whenever they feel heat, they use these as remedies.
</div><div>
In reality, what they refer to as “heat” includes symptoms such as burning sensation in the eyes, burning while passing urine, blood in stools, internal burning sensation, burning feeling on the skin, and similar complaints. All these are signs that water in the body has reduced or is insufficient for the body’s needs. That is why coconut water, buttermilk, and sugar water seem to reduce heat — people assume these have some cooling property. In truth, more than 90 percent of all these liquids is water. It is the water that provides the cooling effect. When water reduces heat, people misinterpret it as something else.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink 5 liters of water every day, steadily from morning till evening, as advised.
</li><li>
Those who avoid drinking water during the day fearing frequent urination end up experiencing excess heat by evening. Never stop drinking water during the daytime.
</li><li>
If you have eaten a lot of heavy or junk food on any day, increase your daytime water intake by another liter — this will prevent excess heat.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>49. How to Prevent Food from Getting Stuck in the Throat While Eating
<a name="chapter49"></a></h1>
<div>
Many people talk while eating. Because of talking, the food is swallowed without being chewed properly. When the mouthful is not crushed well, it cannot pass smoothly through the narrow food pipe and gets stuck in the throat. Some people eat in great haste, finishing their meal within five minutes. For them, the amount of food going in is more than what can smoothly pass down, so it gets stuck in the throat.
</div><div>
It is also a misconception that eating chutneys causes food to stick in the throat. When one eats raw vegetables, fruits, or natural seeds, food does not get stuck for anyone. There is also no need to drink water then. Some people, even when food gets stuck, continue to push more food down. This causes hiccups. Then they remember their mother saying, “Drink seven sips of water,” and when they drink water, the food slides down into the stomach easily and the hiccups stop. Instead of correcting the mistake we make, we try to correct it by drinking water. That water, however, harms the stomach and digestion.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
While eating, chew each mouthful until it becomes soft and paste-like. When this happens, saliva flows well and mixes with the food. This saliva helps the food slide freely from the throat.
</li><li>
Do not talk while eating. Chew slowly and eat calmly for 20 to 30 minutes — this reduces the burden on the stomach.
</li><li>
Eat in such a way that you can swallow the food without even a drop of water. Do not keep water beside you while eating.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>50. How to Get Rid of High Blood Pressure (High BP)
<a name="chapter50"></a></h1>
<div>
People say that once BP comes, it never goes away in a lifetime. BP has become a disease that affects everyone in the household. Once it starts, they say you must keep swallowing medicines for as long as you live. If you eat a lot of salt, BP keeps increasing even if you take medicines. If you reduce salt by half and eat, BP stays under control with medicines and does not rise further. But then the disease does not completely worsen, nor does BP completely go away. It stays with you like a family member.
</div><div>
If you feel that this much control is enough, then avoid salt in curd rice and reduce it in curries. But if you truly want it to go away completely, think a little more. When BP increases if you eat salt, and BP decreases when you reduce salt, then why should BP not go away completely if you stop salt altogether? If you strongly desire to get rid of BP completely without medicines and want to live comfortably, then try to give up salt completely.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Before giving up salt, for 10 to 15 days get into the habit of drinking 5 liters of good water daily and eating raw vegetable juices, sprouted seeds, fruits, and similar foods. These provide the body with the natural salts it needs. If you stop salt without eating these, you may feel dizzy and weak.
</li><li>
Continue taking your BP tablets as usual, but prepare curries completely without salt (to make them tasty, read my book Food – Thought and follow the methods given there), and eat well with unpolished raw rice. If you eat sufficiently, weakness will not occur. Eat this way twice daily.
</li><li>
Once every 5–6 days, check your BP and gradually reduce the medicines (with a doctor’s advice) until you reach a stage where tablets are no longer needed. Within 10 to 20 days, 70–80 percent of people return to normal without medicines.
</li><li>
If you strictly avoid salty foods, outside snacks, and regular salted curries for 2–3 months, then later even if you eat them occasionally — once or twice a month — BP will not return.
</li><li>
But if you go back to regularly eating salt again after some time, then medicines will definitely become necessary once more.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>51. How to Reduce Heel Pain
<a name="chapter51"></a></h1>
<div>
People who are overweight commonly suffer from heel pain. When body weight is more than what is ideal, the heels have to bear this extra load every day. Because of this continuous burden, excessive pressure falls on the heel bones and muscles, resulting in pain. When overweight people try to lose weight by walking, the additional strain from walking often increases the heel pain further. Women who wear high-heeled footwear also commonly experience heel pain.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Overweight people should first stop walking as an exercise.
</li><li>
It is better to use footwear that has a soft, cushioned sole.
</li><li>
Before going to bed at night, pour hot water into a basin and soak the feet in it so that the heels are fully immersed, for 10–15 minutes. After this, go to sleep — the strain accumulated during the day will reduce. If it is difficult to place the foot on the ground immediately after waking up, the same hot-water soaking can be done in the morning as well.
</li><li>
Wearing high-heeled footwear is not advisable.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>52. How to Make Periods Regular
<a name="chapter52"></a></h1>
<div>
Up until 40–50 years ago, women did not face this problem. Today, more than 80% of women of reproductive age are experiencing it. The commonly cited reason is “hormonal imbalance.” When medicines are taken, periods come; when the medicines are stopped, the problem returns. Since these medicines should not be used for long periods, stopping them leaves the issue unresolved.
</div><div>
Hormones are produced by the endocrine glands. These glands are like factories. For example, to produce sugar in a sugar factory, we supply sugarcane as the raw material. How can sugar be produced without supplying sugarcane? In the same way, the glands can produce hormones properly only based on the food we eat. What is their raw material? Without identifying the real mistake, how can the problem be solved? With good food habits, periods become regular for everyone within 3–4 months.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
The more uncooked (raw) food you eat, the faster the problem reduces.
</li><li>
In the morning, stop all other tiffins and drink vegetable juice every day. After one hour, eat a sufficient quantity of 4–5 types of sprouted seeds. Hormone production begins with these sprouts.
</li><li>
In the evening around 4–5 pm, drink one glass of fruit juice (papaya, orange, or pomegranate). After 40–50 minutes (around 6 pm), eat fruits until you feel full and treat that as your meal. Stop eating cooked food thereafter.
</li><li>
At lunchtime, you may cook and eat food in the usual way followed in our tradition.</li>
</ol>

<h1>53. How to Keep Hair Black
<a name="chapter53"></a></h1>
<div>
In earlier days, hair was only of two kinds — black or white. These days, just like a chameleon changing colors, human hair is turning into many different shades. On a single head, you can see four or five different colors of hair. Our ancestors applied coconut oil generously to their hair every day. Because of this, no matter how much they moved around in the sun, the heat did not change the color of their hair. In fact, it remained black.
</div><div>
When there is oil on the hair, the sun’s rays cannot damage the hair color; instead, the oil slowly evaporates and protects the hair. But today, people avoid applying oil every day thinking it will look greasy, spoil facial beauty, or make the hair flat. Because of not applying oil at all, hair is turning reddish and losing its natural color.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Every day, take a head bath with cool water, dry the hair thoroughly, and while the hair is still soft (slightly moist), apply a small amount of coconut oil. That is enough.
</li><li>
If oil is applied later in the afternoon after the hair has completely dried, more oil is required, and the reddish discoloration sets in sooner.
</li><li>
To remove excess oiliness, you can apply lemon juice to the scalp and then wash your hair (without using shampoos).
</li><li>
By applying a little oil this way, the hair remains black throughout the day, and grey hair does not show prominently.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>54. How to Relieve Toothache
<a name="chapter54"></a></h1>
<div>
This problem is more common in children. Those who consume a lot of sweets, ice creams, and chocolates tend to damage their teeth quickly. When teeth decay and cavities form, food particles get trapped inside these holes. Harmful microorganisms then grow there and cause infection and pain. Once a tooth decays, no matter what we do, it cannot return to its original healthy state. However, it is in our hands to protect the remaining teeth from decaying further through proper food habits.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Twice a day, rinse the mouth with lukewarm neem-leaf water. (Boil a handful of neem leaves in a glass of water, let it cool, strain it, and use that water.) Hold it in the mouth and gargle for 10–15 minutes.
</li><li>
When there is infection or throbbing pain, place a drop of honey into the cavity of the tooth. This can be done 3–4 times a day. Honey has properties that kill bacteria, and for mild pain it gives good relief.
</li><li>
If the pain becomes unbearable, taking a painkiller may eventually become unavoidable.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>55. How to Strengthen Bones
<a name="chapter55"></a></h1>
<div>
It is commonly said that bones become weak with age, and that in women, especially around the time of menopause, bones become brittle and prone to fractures. To prevent this, many people take calcium tablets and drink milk. However, using calcium tablets for a long time can lead to the formation of stones inside the body, and milk is not very beneficial for adults (it is mainly useful for children).
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Grind fresh coconut and raw sesame seeds into a soft mixture. Add a little cardamom powder and make small balls using honey or mashed dates. Eat one ball daily.
A ball about the size of a large lemon can be eaten. It can be taken in the morning along with sprouts.
</li><li>
Coconut and sesame seeds contain almost all the nutrients required for healthy bones. Since this mixture contains raw sesame seeds and fresh coconut, prepare it fresh and do not store it for more than 1–2 days.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>56. How to Eliminate Body Odours
<a name="chapter56"></a></h1>
<div>
Some people look fine externally, but unpleasant smells come from within the body. If there is a strong smell from phlegm, saliva, sweat, urine, and stool, it means that a lot of internal waste has accumulated. Instead of constantly changing toothpastes and soaps, or cleaning bathrooms with phenyl, try to clean the dirt inside your body. The stronger these five smells are, the higher the chance of diseases developing inside, or of long-term illnesses setting in.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
To eliminate foul smell from stools, clean the intestines with enemas.
</li><li>
To reduce the smell of urine and saliva, drink about 5 litres of water daily.
</li><li>
To reduce body odour from sweat, take steam therapy for the skin twice a week.
</li><li>
When these four are cleaned regularly, the mouth will also gradually become clean.
</li><li>
Foods that clean the body more and leave less waste inside are uncooked (raw) foods. Therefore, try to eat 60–70% of your daily diet raw.
</li><li>
If you eat only fruits for the evening meal and stop eating early, body odours will disappear faster and overall health will improve.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>57. How to Relieve Scalp Itching
<a name="chapter57"></a></h1>
<div>
Every day, impurities released from the skin accumulate on the scalp and remain there. As they build up, harmful germs grow in that area and cause itching. Some people wash their hair only once every 7–8 days, thinking that daily head baths will cause hair fall or that the hair will not dry properly. Such people often suffer from scalp itching. Lice also breed only when the scalp is dirty. Especially in women, lice tend to remain continuously when the scalp is not kept clean.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
If you wash your head daily with cold water, the itching will subside within 4–5 days.
</li><li>
If the itching is severe, apply lemon juice well to the scalp and then take a head bath.
</li><li>
If you skip head baths for even 2–3 days, the itching will return immediately. Therefore, it is best to consider the head as much a part of the body as the rest, and wash it daily.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>58. How to Relieve Nasal Congestion
<a name="chapter58"></a></h1>
<div>
In people who drink very little water, nasal congestion occurs frequently when mucus accumulates in the nose. This problem is more common in small children. Because air cannot pass freely through the nose, they are forced to breathe through the mouth.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
When mucus has accumulated, give warm (lukewarm) water to drink more frequently and in larger quantities.
</li><li>
Apply honey inside the nostrils by inserting a finger as far as comfortable. After some time, the mucus becomes thinner, comes out, and airflow improves.
</li><li>
If possible, taking steam inhalation for the face twice a day provides quick relief.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>59. How to Experience Taste More Fully
<a name="chapter59"></a></h1>
<div>
Even though we eat mainly for taste, we usually experience only about 50–60% of the actual flavor of food. It is not the tongue alone that perceives taste. When the mind supports the tongue, the taste can be experienced fully.
</div><div>
After cooking, women often taste the food by placing a small amount on the hand, licking it, and immediately closing their eyes for a moment to assess it. At that moment, they clearly sense what is lacking or excessive. Many people unknowingly close their eyes so that the mind does not wander and can focus entirely on the tongue.
</div><div>
When you eat while keeping your mind on the TV, newspapers, or conversations with others, you cannot truly experience the taste that is present. As a result, no matter how much you eat, you end up feeling dissatisfied rather than satisfied.
</div><div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Every day, while eating, chew thoroughly so that the food mixes well with saliva. When saliva mixes with food, the taste becomes richer.
</li><li>
Keeping the food in the mouth longer and chewing slowly allows you to enjoy the taste for a longer time.
</li><li>
Some people hurriedly swallow food into the stomach—but the stomach cannot taste.
</li><li>
While eating, avoid talking, focus your mind, and eat silently. Notice how much difference it makes and how much satisfaction it brings.
</li>
</ol>

<h1>60. How to Reduce Belly Fat
<a name="chapter60"></a></h1>
<div>
Ideally, the abdomen should be such that when you pinch the sides of the navel with two fingers, the flesh fits between them and measures about one inch in thickness. Also, if you place a plumb line (the type used by masons to check straightness) at the center of the chest, the abdomen should form a straight vertical line downwards like a wall.
</div><div>
But in many of us, when we try to use such a line, it veers outward. The belly has grown so large that it cannot be grasped even with all the fingers, let alone just two. That is the extent to which it needs to be reduced.
</div><div>
When bathing without clothes, everyone clearly sees the true shape of their belly and feels embarrassed at that moment — but once dressed again, it is quickly forgotten. Many believe that belly fat comes from eating and sleeping during the day, but that is not really the case.
</div><div>
<b>Causes:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
People who drink a lot of water while eating tend to develop a protruding belly. Some drink excessive water to reduce food intake and then eat immediately. That water stays in the stomach along with the food, and the continuous weight causes the belly to bulge forward.
</li><li>
Those who eat more rice and fewer vegetables consume excess carbohydrates. What the body does not need is converted into fat and stored in fat cells.
</li><li>
Eating late at night, around 10 or 11 p.m., causes the body—being in a resting state—to store most of the food consumed, which contributes significantly to belly fat.
</li><li>
In our jobs and businesses, only the hands and legs move; the abdominal region hardly moves at all. Even in most exercises, this area gets very little movement. As a result, the belly keeps protruding more and more each day.
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<b>Remedies:</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
Drink water only when the stomach is empty. Drinking water on an empty stomach prevents the belly from protruding.
</li><li>
Those who want to reduce belly fat should completely avoid rice and instead eat rotis (phulkas) with plenty of vegetables (about three-fourths of the meal should be vegetables). In the morning, having only sprouted grains as breakfast helps melt stored fat.
</li><li>
For the evening meal, avoid cooked foods and, by 6 p.m., eat fruits such as guava, pomegranate, papaya, Indian jujube, orange, or watermelon. After that, avoid eating late at night.
</li><li>
To reduce belly fat, yoga postures are more effective than other exercises. The lower belly and upper belly are distinct, and there are two specific postures for reducing each: Uttanpadasana for the lower abdomen, Naukasana for the upper abdomen
</li><li>
Practicing these two postures twice daily melts belly fat very quickly. You can also refer to the yoga postures book written by the author. Within 2–3 months, more than half of the belly fat can be reduced. Start early and enhance your appearance.
</li>
</ol>
