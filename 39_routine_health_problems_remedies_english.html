<h1>What is an appropriate treatment??</h1>
<div>
Medical Sciences advanced a lot these days and there is a need for more advancement in the near future. For the Benefit of mankind many great people invented wide variety of medical techniques and procedures in the form of Ayurveda ,allopathy, Unani, homeopathy etc. They are of great benefit to mankind. They are providing such a relief when we approach them with pain and diseased. Any medical procedure can benefit us  either to complete extent or to some extent, sometimes it's not help us  in solving our problems instead  it may make us more unhealthy.Even do they are useful, only people who are diseased  only can use them, it has no role as prophylaxis.For Example: If a person was  suffering from stomach ache,  and a tablet  is helping him to relieve it, but  the same tablet if used by a healthy person, can't help him in  prevention of stomach ache, it instead can cause many side effects. All the above mentioned  medical procedures  work the same manner  except naturopathy for example: if a person is suffering from stomach ache,enema  is done, it cleans his intestine and patient is  well fed to relieve the pain. This procedure  can also be used in people who are healthy and  protects them from  developing stomach ache  in future.  every treatment here  has same impaction both  diseased  and healthy people. It is like a double  edged  sword, works in both ways.  Naturopathy suits so well to human body, treatment and our body gets along so well,  that these  are no side effect. If  we try to protect ourselves from minor ailments by using naturopathy, it benefits our body. If we face a health problem, first we should  at least try to cure it by  using natural medicine. If it is not helping  reducing your problem  then there is a need to obtain medical approach. I am writing this techniques down, so that you can treat minor ailments  naturally and remain healthy. There  are no adverse  effects to this techniques. So there is no need of following them  if diseased, it can be used by  healthy  people also.I hope you follow these health remedies and  take good care of your health, I am writing them  in 2 parts, I hope you accept them  whole heartedly. Animals do solve  their problems naturally . If there  feel nauseating,  they  eat  food that doesn't suit their body and vomit, if they are not hungry, they starve  themselves and eat food only when they are hungry. They never study and they have no one to  provide them with  health tips, even we are gifted the same type of body and have more knowledge and intelligence, we need to  behave in much  sensible manner and deal With your problems so efficiently if we are aware upper body and health conditions unable to treat ourselves we are the ones at loss. I hope you all utilise this chance of reading yourself I things that are available in your  household. Stay healthy and happy

<h1>5. How can we decrease joint pains??
<a name="chapter05"></a></h1>
<div>
People are suffering from joint pain even before the age of 40,50 years.This is because the synovial fluid in the joints is decreasing,people say bones are getting worn out.If our body is designed to live for 100 years ,how can our joints get worned out for 40 to 50 years.Even elephant is gifted with same 100 years of life,its weight is not causing joint pains,swelling or decrease in synovial fluid why so?Because elephant knows what to consume we on the other hand doesnt know what to consume.It is leading to decreased capacity of synovial fluid production and decreased wear and tear of joints.Consuming salty foods is increasing salt content in synovial fluid causing wear and tear of cartilage and joints.As long as salt is consumed,our joints never get better.Instead of decreasing salt content,we are trying many medical procedures wasting money,but not feeling better.There is no other choice,we need to decrease the salt content,this sacrifice is worth it.
</div><div>
<b>Tips:</b> 
<ol>
